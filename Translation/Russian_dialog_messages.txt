у орков очень прочная броня, а также они могут с лёгкостью заблокировать тебя. Но они не могут заблокировать то, что сзади их или, ещё лучше, что они не могут видеть.%
приветствую, родич, твоё поселение намного лучше, чем я ожидал, мои товарищи хотят найти работу, просто скажи им, куда идти, и они пойдут работать.%
если поселение станет слишком большим, мы привлечём больше врагов. мы должны сразить их, прежде чем это произойдёт, мы должны подумать о строительстве крепости с частоколом.%
работа%
мы должны отрубить голову оркам к северу отсюда, прежде чем они станут слишком сильными. Ты должен найти орка, которого они называют «поработитель». он обитает в форте к северу отсюда.%
да, скоро. Когда у меня будет больше информации, я скажу тебе, и мы сможем продолжить истреблять орочьих тиранов на земле.%
привет, родич! ты потихоньку становишься властелином, твоё поселение развивается очень хорошо.%
лесной гном, которого я спас, поручил мне убить одного из лидеров орков в этом регионе.%
поработитель мёртв, а лесной гном, возможно, вскоре захочет продолжить эту месть.%
я слышал, что орки порождают злобный вид орков, они называют их берсерками, дикими зверями войны.%
я простой работяга, но я возглавил нескольких из нас, чтобы помочь нам сплотиться вместе.%
нежить на востоке отличается от той, что на западе. там живут люди, от чего нежити становится больше и она сильнее с каждым днём.%
да здравствует герой! у меня есть информация о следующей крепости, мы должны победить в ней злого лидера.%
этот некромант приносит порчу в наши земли, ты убил жалкого паразита?%
оплот%
ещё один в пустыне, я слышал, что некромант призвал нежить, чтобы помочь ему построить крепость. Его нужно остановить.%
ты не перестаёшь удивлять, юный герой! Я сообщу тебе, когда найду другую крепость.%
твоя сила растёт, герой! Я сообщу тебе, когда найду другую крепость для завоевания.%
лесной гном нашёл крепость некроманта и хочет, чтобы я прекратил её существование.%
некромант мёртв, награда заслужена.%
я слышал, что орки порождают злобный вид орков, они называют их берсерками, дикими зверями войны.%
я простой работяга, но я возглавил нескольких из нас, чтобы помочь нам сплотиться вместе.%
твои товарищи-гномы странно смотрят на меня, разве они раньше никогда не встречали человека?%
здравствуй, добрый господин, рад видеть вас. Поселение, что вы заложили, довольно хорошее, надеюсь, вы не возражаете, если я останусь.%
всё кажется знакомым, но другим. Я останусь здесь, пока не приду в себя.%
работа%
О, ты уже сделал для меня более чем достаточно, я не могу просить ничего большего.%
извини, я не знаком с этим местом. Я не видел вокруг других людей, не так ли?%
раньше я был дворецким, у меня неплохо это получается. Но я... я сильно заблудился, я не уверен, где находится поместье моего господина...%
у орков очень прочная броня, а также они могут с лёгкостью заблокировать тебя. Но они не могут заблокировать то, что сзади их или, ещё лучше, что они не могут видеть.%
да здравствует герой! у меня есть информация о следующей крепости, мы должны победить в ней злого лидера.%
ты убил «мертвоглаза-поработителя»? он могущественный враг, будь осторожен.%
оплот%
посреди красной пустыни я отправил одного из наших родичей, чтобы помочь тебе попасть внутрь. лидера зовут «мертвоглаз», вперёд, герой! и побеждай!%
ты не перестаёшь удивлять, юный герой! Я сообщу тебе, когда найду другую крепость.%
твоя сила растёт, герой! Я сообщу тебе, когда найду другую крепость для завоевания.%
лесной гном нашёл ещё одну крепость и хочет, чтобы я убил вождя в ней.%
вождь мёртв, а я вознаграждён монетой и похвалой.%
я слышал, что орки порождают злобный вид орков, они называют их берсерками, дикими зверями войны.%
я простой работяга, но я возглавил нескольких из нас, чтобы помочь нам сплотиться вместе.%
присматривай за своими работниками, убедись, что они не расслабляются.%
приветствую, герой, у тебя тут прекрасное поселение! я - искусный строитель, думаю, что мои навыки могут пригодиться здесь.%
не беспокойтесь о жилье, я разберусь с этим. Я прослежу, чтобы у каждого гнома была крыша над головой.%
навыки%
кстати о навыках, у нас тут должен быть кузнец. Я знаю одного товарища, который живёт поблизости, возможно, ты мог бы уговорить его присоединиться к нашему поселению.%
всегда хорошо иметь несколько талантливых рук.%
кажется, всё идёт довольно хорошо. приятно видеть, что наши родичи снова собираются вместе.%
строитель попросил меня позвать его друга, кузнеца, присоединиться к нашему поселению.%
строитель был рад, что его друг, кузнец, присоединился к нашему поселению.%
к северу отсюда есть несколько хлопковых ферм. Я не уверен, сколько ещё работает, но стоило бы посмотреть.%
строитель сказал, что к северу отсюда находятся несколько хлопковых ферм, и отметил несколько мест на моей карте.%
Я бригадир, строительство - моя профессия. Я прослежу, чтобы у наших рабочих была крыша над головой.%
не расслабляйся, герой. Ты не столкнёшься с медлительными врагами, как раньше, эти военачальники быстры и носят мощное оружие.%
да здравствует герой, у меня для тебя есть последнее задание, если ты согласен, то это будет для тебя настоящим испытанием.%
орочьи военачальники должны быть истреблены, чтобы обеспечить вечный мир и выживание для наших родичей.%
последнее задание%
на этом континенте осталось ещё пять орочьих военачальников. Все они обитают в юго-восточных пустошах. победи их, и ты станешь легендой.%
ты освободил наших родичей, низверг наших врагов и обеспечил вечный мир для нашего вида. Молодец, герой.%
для меня большая честь быть рядом с тобой, герой, книги и песни будут написаны о твоих деяниях.%
лесной гном поручил мне убить последних пяти военачальников.%
военачальники мертвы, континент освобождён от орков, а меня прозвали настоящим героем.%
мои разведчики рассказали, что военачальники - это берсерки, сущие кошмары, орки, которые быстры и беспощадны.%
я простой работяга, но я возглавил нескольких из нас, чтобы помочь нам сплотиться вместе.%

работа%
у меня сейчас нет для тебя работы, возможно, она найдётся, когда мы вернёмся в поселение%
я бригадир, я профессионал в своей области, я могу помочь построить самые большие строения и улучшить уже построенные%
мы могли бы использовать шатёр для хранения, чтобы запасать припасы для других построек.%
Снова здравствуй, нужны мои услуги?%
шатёр для хранения%
да, шатёр для хранения был бы хорошим началом нашего поселения, тебе нужно собрать немного древесины и кожи для его постройки.%
отлично, у нас появился шатёр для хранения, теперь мы сможем возводить другие строения.%
я очень признателен, что я здесь, и рад, что мои услуги будут полезны.%
лекарь рекомендует мне построить шатёр для хранения, чтобы мы могли расширять наше поселение.%
я построил шатёр для хранения, лекарь сказал, что мы могли бы использовать несколько рабочих, чтобы заполнить его.%
я знаю несколько безопасных районом поблизости, тебе стоит начать своё путешествие оттуда. Однако, тебе сначала придётся разведать область, чтобы отправиться туда.%
наш лекарь показал мне несколько мест на карте, которые можно изучить.%
я первоклассный лекарь, я могу вылечить все виды болезней... за монеты, конечно.%
будь осторожен при исследовании пещер, они всегда полны монстров, всех видов%
неплохая вещичка, которые вы здесь собираетесь взять, уверен, что она вырастет%
мне действительно хочется иметь собсвенную кузницу и работать на ней%
работа%
у меня сейчас нет для тебя работы, возможно, если ты построишь кузницу, она появится%
нам понадобится камень, чтобы построить кузницу, я слышал, что на востоке есть хороший источник%
городской кузнец сказала мне, что в пещере к востоку отсюда есть хороший запас камня.%
я кузнец по профессии, моя семья давно овладела этим искусством, и оно передаётся из поколения в поколение%
продолжая развивать своё поселение, вы привлечёте больше гномов, которые заходят прийти и поселиться, наша численность возрастёт%
приветствую, герой, у вас здесь достаточно уютненько, я не мог упустить возможность зайти выпить%
прекрасный день, не так ли?%
работа%
раз ты упомянул об этом, ты мог бы помочь мне. мой старый друг пропал без вести, его звали гурт, усил ты узнаешь что-то о нём, дай мне знать.%
я никогда не думал, что ты найдёшь моего старого друга, спасибо.%
родич, ты настоящий герой.%
посетивший торговец сказал, что давно ничего не слышал от своего друга, гурта.%
торговец обрадовался, узнав, что его друг в порядке, он, кажется, заинтересован в том, чтобы остаться в поселении.%
мне приходится быть странствующим торговцем, но у меня сейчас ничего нет, и может потребоваться некоторое время, чтобы вернуть меня на ноги%
приветствую, герой, у меня есть несколько предметов на продажу, а также немного золота, которое я готов потратить на покупку твоего снаряжения%
у меня было бы намного больше, если бы мы построили торговую станцию, я мог бы уговорить некоторых других торговцев придти сюда%
работа%
если ты не возражаешь, я бы хотел, чтобы ты навестил моего старого друга, он живет в лачуге у озера к югу отсюда. Я заплачу как только узнаю узнаю, что он всё ещё жив.%

приветствую, герой, у меня есть несколько предметов на продажу, а также немного золота, которое я готов потратить на покупку твоего снаряжения%
Торговец попросил меня навестить его старого друга, который, видимо, живёт в одиночестве.%
он обрадовался, узнав, что его старый друг всё ещё там, но не удивлён его состоянием.%
я слышал разговоры о короле гоблинов, по-видимому, он процветает, и у него давняя вражда: он хочет навсегда избавиться от гномов%
я странствующий торговец, хочешь посмотреть мои товары?%
всегда ищи источник материалов, нам понадобятся различные вещи, чтобы построить это поселение.%
это отличное место, чтобы начать поселение! Всё, что нам нужно, это пара рабочих, чтобы помочь собрать материалы.%
готов к исследованиям? куда бы ты хотел пойти?%
рабочие%
если мы поможем нашим родичам, они, несомненно, помогут нам. Поблизости есть лагерь гоблинов, возможно, они захватили одного из наших братьев.%
хорошо иметь лишнюю пару рук, но мы всегда можем сделать еще немного.%
поселение раст`т, у тебя хорошо получается, родич.%
караванщик сказал мне, что подозревает, что недалеко от нашего поселения находится лагерь гоблинов.%
я нашёл лагерь и спас одного гнома, он сможет помочь нам в развитии нашего поселения.%
Поблизости есть ферма, я уверен, что она будет хорошим источником еды, если она нам когда-нибудь понадобится.%
караванщик сказал мне, что поблизости есть ферма, она может быть хорошим источником еды.%
я караванщик, я веду этот караван туда, куда потребуется.%
тебе понадобится много ресурсов, чтобы построить своё поселение, добыча их может занять некоторое время, но самый простой способ, чтобы получить их - собирать их из близлежащих регионов.%
приветствую, родич, я - следопыт, я в этих краях довольно долго и надеюсь, ты не возражаешь, если я останусь здесь на некоторое время.%
прекрасный день для охоты, как думаешь?%

страшный шаман-гоблин месяцами ускользает от меня, я думаю, что он разбил лагерь в лесах к югу отсюда, пожалуйста, убей его, если сможешь, и вознаграждение не заставит себя ждать.%

да здравствует герой! как дела?%
в моё поселение пришёл рейнджер и попросил меня найти и убить шамана-гоблина.%
я убил шамана-гоблина, которого попросил меня убить рейнджер, он наградил меня золотом.%
король гоблинов процветает, я слышал, что его тронный зал находится в самом сердце горы ротгар. его нужно остановить.%
я рейнджер, я странсвую по дикий землям и живу за счёт земли, я не останавливаюсь в одном месте на долго, хотя, я мог бы остаться здесь на некоторое время.%
мы должны выкапывать больше руды и работать на переработчике, чтобы собрать больше металлов.%
теперь, когда у нас есть кузница, возможно, мы могли бы найти знания о том, как построить рунную кузницу.%
я рад, что у нас теперь есть кузница, я могу продолжить свою торговлю. Хочешь взглянуть, что у меня есть на продажу?%
рунная кузница%
я слышал о послушнике, который охранял холодную рунную кузницу, он понимает пути наших древних родичей, возможно, он мог бы научить тебя, как её построить.%
рунная кузница очень мощная, и может быть использована для наполнения оружия невероятными способностями.%
как там дела с рунной кузницей?%
кузнец рассказал мне о послушнике, который мог бы научить меня строительству рунной кузницы.%
кузнец был рад услышать о послушнике, и считает, что мы должны построить рунную кузницу как можно скорее.%

я очень рад тебя видеть.%

пока я в безопасности, спасибо, я вернусь и посмотрю, как дела у моего друга%
спасибо, ты спас мне жизнь.%
я нашёл ферина, он случайно загнал себя в тупик на высокие руины, убегая от парочки гоблинов.%
я избавился от гоблинов и встретился с ферином, он в порядке, и хочет, чтобы я сообщил его другу.%
я слышал, что в этих руинах были захоронены ценные реликвии, но мне не повезло.%
я простой гном, я просто ищу работу, где я могу помочь%

когда мы уходим?%
приветствую, герой, я очень хочу увидеть твоё поселение%
я встретил странствующего торговца в одной из руин, он, кажется, заинтересован в том, чтобы присоединиться к моему поселению.%
я пригласил торговца присоединиться к поселению, он очень хочет поскорее придти.%
я путешествующий торговец, но мне нужно где-то поселиться и начать свои торговые пути от%
древесина является важным ресурсом для создания твоего поселения, я бы рекомендовал тебе держать постоянный запас это материала%
приветствую, путник, ты не видел моего товарища, ферина?%
и снова привет, ты уже нашёл ферина?%
Ферин%
ах да, ферин мой друг, он ушёл  и не возвращается уже некоторое время, я беспокоюсь, что он, возможно, был схвачен, пожалуйста, дай мне знать, если увидишь его%
хорошо, что ты нашёл его, он немного рассеянный, не может справиться сам без меня%
спасибо, что выудил ферина из беды, я посмотрю, что можно сделать, чтобы достать его%
гном по имени ферин пропал без вести, его друг попросил меня найти его, он может быть в беде.%
я сообщил обеспокоенному гному о его друге ферине и о том, что произошло. он наградил меня своими сбережениями.%
к югу отсюда есть ещё несколько руин, но они ведут в болото, если приключение - это то, что ты ищешь, то это место наверняка подойдёт%
лесной гном рассказал мне о некоторых болотах на юге.%
я лесоруб по профессии, всю жизнь работаю на лесопилках%
если ты здесь, чтобы помочь, не стесняйся, посмотри, что у меня есть.%
привет, путешественник, мне бы пригодилась твоя помощь, чтобы избавиться от нескольких кобольдов, они достаточно поднадоели.%
ты избавился ото всех кобольдов? нет? что насчёт этих кроликов?%
кобольды%
мою ферму продолжают наводнять кобольды, а у меня нет сил, чтобы прогнать их, я вознагражу тебя, если ты сможешь избавиться от них, и помогу тебе всем, чем смогу.%
да, мерзкие создания, я рад, что ты от них избавился, теперь мне просто нужно беспокоиться о проклятых кроликах. возвращайся, когда захочешь.%
Мне бы не помешала помощь с фермой, ты можешь прислать работников, если нуждаешься в припасах.%
у местного фермера проблемы с кобольдами, наводняющими его ферму, он попросил моей помощи, чтобы уничтожить их.%
я убил кобольдов, и фермер был очень доволен, я могу взять себе столько еды, сколько мне нужно.%
я слышал, что рядом есть пещера, ты можешь исследовать её, если хочешь, я отмечу её на твоей карте.%
местный фермер рассказал мне о пещере неподалёку, он побоялся в неё войти.%
я фермер, я держу свой участок в течение многих лет, и, надеюсь, продержу ещё долго.%
привет, родич, рад тебя видеть! мы могли бы использовать некоторых авантюристов в здешних краях, от этих скрывающихся гоблинов ничего хорошего%
здесь прячутся гоблины, ты их уже нашёл?%
есть один особенно противный гоблин. он закован в железо, если ты избавишься от него, это может заставить других подумать дважды о возвращении%
я рад, что ты избавился от них, они заполонили континент%
я чувствую себя намного безопаснее, зная, что ты нам помог%
несколько гоблинов разбили лагерь снаружи хлопковой фермы, её жител попросили меня убить их лидера.%
хлопковые фермеры были благодарны за мою помощь, но им всё ещё может понадобиться помощь.%
я помогаю сажать и собирать хлопчатник, все становятся занятыми, когда приходит время собирать урожай%
я слышал, что шаманы часто используют магию, они могут управлять определёнными элементами, тебе лучше быть поосторожнее%
мне не нравится вид этого места, здесь может быть опасно%
ты готов уйти? .. Я%
работа? нет, не у меня, спроси кого-нибудь другого%
ты думаешь, что здесь затаился гоблин-шаман? так думал рейнджер%
никогда не упускай возможность набрать больше людей для своего поселения, ты никогда не знаешь, что может принести каждый%
этот лес довольно густой, по крайней мере, ты можешь здесь найти какую-нибудь дичь%
много чего нашёл здесь?%
за последнее время я пропустил многое%
волки быстры и неостановимы, ты должен быть готов к сражению с ними, иначе они тебя сожрут.%
так это ты создал поселение? ну, я мог бы предложить свою помощь, но я хотел бы посмотреть, достоин ли ты.%
всё ещё не разобрался с этими волками? я не думаю, что ты сможешь.%
здесь неподалёку стая волков, я обычно могу справиться с ними сам, но у такого воина, как ты, не должно быть особых проблем. если ты убьёшь их, я подумаю о присоединении к твоему поселению.%
у тебя есть талант, я дарую тебе это, но мы посмотрим, что ждёт тебя в будущем.%
я соберу свои вещи и встречу тебя через день.%
гном-кузнец заинтересован в присоединении к моему поселению, но мне нужно будет доказать ему, избавившись от местных волков%
кузнец был доволен, и он согласился присоединиться к моему поселению%
я не был в окрестностях, я не знаю, что происходит за пределами моей территории.%
я слышал о поселении, которое ты создал, кажется, это настоящий рай. Я не присоединюсь к тебе, но я рад помочь припасами%
у тебя есть всё необходимое?%
я регулярно рублю деревья и поддерживаю хорошие запасы древесины, но в последнее время несколько гоблинов поселилось в лесу, они прогонят меня, если ты с ними что-нибудь не сделаешь%
я должен быть в состоянии поддерживать хороший запас с этими гоблинами с моего пути%
приходи в любое время, я рад, что для твоего поселения теперь есть древесина%
гном-дровосек попросил меня избавиться от назойливых гоблинов.%
я уничтожил гоблинов, и гном-дровосек наградил меня некоторым запасом древесины.%
я держу в себе, я не получаю много слов%
эти сосны выглядят высокими и крепкими, хороши для стабильного снабжения древесиной.%
как там сосны? здесь безопасно?%
осторожно, если ты когда-нибудь увидишь орка, он наверняка захочет убить тебя%
приветствую, родич, ты пришёл нам на помощь?%
ты уже избавился от этих гоблинов?%
поговори с уристом, он расскажет тебе о наших проблемах%
некоторые считают, что величайшие и самые смертоносные враги находятся под землёй, забытые веками%
я шахтёр, истинное занятие для гнома%
я буду ждать здесь, я не думаю, что безопасно вести караван дальше, если его захватят, мы можем надолго застрять здесь%
смотри в оба в темноте, легко что-то упустить%
какое облегчение, что ты здесь, мы были изгнаны из этих пещер кровавыми гоблинами, недели тяжёлой работы впустую.%
ты нашёл урида?%
они выгнали нас несколько дней назад, но прежде схватили нашего друга урида, он всё ещё там, я могу только надеяться, что он всё ещё жив%
ещё раз спасибо за помощь. Ты должен прийти навестить нас на нашем новом месте добычи, возможно, мы могли бы помочь вашему поселению%
вы нам очень помогли, мы снова начнём добычу, возможно, мы могли бы как-то помочь вашему поселению.%
один из шахтёров-гномов потерял друга среди гоблинов, которые прогнали их, они хотели бы, чтобы я помог им спасти его.%
шахтёры были рады узнать, что их друг в безопасности, и рассказали мне о другой шахте.%
некоторый народ считает, что величайшие и самые смертоносные враги находятся под землёй, забытые веками%
я шахтёр, всегда им был, никогда не любил свет%
хорошо, что ты здесь, у меня проблемы с моей повозкой, мне нужна помощь в починке колеса%
ты нашёл достаточно дерева, чтобы починить мою повозку?%
мне нужен кто-то, кто поможет мне починить колесо, без него я никуда не поеду. Мне нужно около 10 древесины, чтобы сделать это%
спасибо за помощь, но мне больше ничего не нужно%
Я веду этот караван, сквозь дождь, град или свет, это моя работа%
смотри в оба, когда ты в темноте, легко пропустить что-то%
как мне повезло, ты выбрал идеальное время.%
я думаю, что пришло время присоединиться к поселению, так безопаснее%
у меня нет ничего для тебя, ты уже сделал достаточно для меня, спасибо%
я слышал, как эти гоблины говорили о своём короле, не так ли? ещё один король гоблинов?%
я шахтёр, всегда им был, никогда не любил свет%
осторожно, если ты исследуешь пещеры, там король гоблинов, я видел его своими глазами, здоровенный негодник!%
привет, родич, гурт - это имя, чудно видеть тебя здесь, у меня есть некоторые проблемы, может быть, ты мог бы помочь%
скоро я получу голову этого шамана.%
я исследовал эту пещеру, когда наткнулся на гнилых гоблинов, я сбежал до того, как этот шаман добрался до меня, думаешь, ты мог бы помочь мне вернуться туда и разобраться с гнилыми?%
ты был отличным помощником, и мы оба помогли подавить продвижение наших врагов на этой земле%
спасибо за помощь, приятель!%
гурт, искатель приключений, чуть не был убит в этой пещере шаманом-гоблином, он попросил моей помощи.%
шаман-гоблин мёртв, и гурт наградил меня некоторыми своими находками.%
у меня есть хороший друг, путешествующий торговец, я уверен, что он зайдёт в ваше поселение, если он придёт. Дай ему знать, что я в порядке!%
авантюрист в пещере рассказал мне о своём друге, странствующем торговце, он попросил передать ему привет%
я авантюрист, жизнь исследования-это все, ради чего я могу жить.%
я должен был оставить караван наверху, но мы можем подняться, когда вы будете готовы уйти%
нашли что-нибудь полезное? может, нам стоит убраться отсюда?%
ещё один набор руин, кажется, здесь много%
это выглядит как хороший маленький город, я уверен, что люди хорошие%
нашли что-нибудь полезное?%
привет путешественник, я слышал о вашем поселении, и, возможно, мы могли бы помочь вам%
я хочу, чтобы эти гоблины оставили нас в покое%
мы остро нуждаемся в вашей помощи. Гоблины продолжают прибывать к границе нашего города. их ведёт какой-то чудовищный орк в соснах к северу отсюда, если ты убьёшь их лидера, я уверен, они оставят нас в покое.%
благодаря вашей помощи, мы можем продолжить давние традиции хлопководства нашего поколения, ещё раз спасибо, родич%
воистину, мы в долгу перед тобой, помоги себе во всем, что тебе нужно, я принесла все из хранилища%
орк ведёт гоблинов на войну, если я убью его, это может облегчить стресс для местных фермеров.%
хлопковый фермер был очень благодарен, узнав, что орк мёртв, и охотно открыл свой сарай для хранения.%
есть местный фермер, который поселился в руинах неподалёку, некоторые говорят, что он сошёл с ума. интересно, с ним все в порядке?%
i'm a cotton and rope weed farmer, i've been tending these fields for generations%
the cotton farmers were grateful for my aid, they seem to have quite a few problems.%
isnt this the place that dwarf told us about? think we'll find that builder?%
have you found that builder?%
yikes, it's chilly here. I feel awfully unsafe for some reason.%
something is on the wind, the wild's here are vicious, we ought to watch out.%
greetings kin! if you're looking for trouble, there is plenty to go around.%
have you slain that beast?%
yes, there's an orc war chief not far from here, he's setup camp, i fear we'll be driven off soon.%
not anymore, thanks to you.%
we're much safer thanks to you.%
a local orc commander has setup camp near some locals in the desert, they need my help getting rid of him%
i informed the locals of the orc's death, they were pleased to hear it and rewarded me with food and coin.%
there is a goblin stockade northeast of here, i think that's where they've been coming from lately.%
i suppose im the local militia, but we all do what we're best at, i lend a hand at tilling from time to time%
Thank goodness! They ate one of us already!%
be careful, orcs are much stronger than goblins, they capture our kind for sport%
talk to rellian, he has work for you%
i farm these lands, though there isnt much left, we survive%
don't kill too many rabbits, you'll upset the queen%
huh? what? who are you? what are you doing in my kingdom... err... farm, you arent really here are you?%
you're still here? come to steal my beetle collection? hmmm? i don't think so, matey%
you want something to do, huh? well, go kill the orc i trapped in my shed, i want to use it for storage again%
i should use more of my imaginations to solve my problems%
you should get that spot checked, i had one just like it, right before i dropped dead%
this crazy farmer says there's an orc trapped in his storage shed, he's probably hallucinating%
the orc is dead, and this crazy farmer doesn't even remember it existed... i guess there wont be a reward%
i know where all these rabbits are coming from... the queen is nearby, i'll find her hideout soon enough.%
apparently there are some more ruins to the north... but i dont think there's a rabbit queen there.%
i'm the king of verin, and i enjoy going for long walks, watching sunsets and collecting beetles%
is this where that crazy farmer lives? be careful... he could be unstable%
have you met the farmer? has he lost his marbles like they say?%
it seems quiet here, see what you can find%
find anything interesting?%
greetings traveller, are you investigating these ruins as well?%
i havent found anything, but i'm sure there's still something here%
i dont have any quests for you, i've plenty to do myself%
apparently ruins like this still have buried heirlooms hidden within, i'm looking to find one for myself%
i'm just an adventurer%
i have a bad feeling about this place%
i'm glad to see you're still in one piece, should we get out of here?%
this is quaint, i wonder if whoever lives here is nice%
i hear most fighters underestimate the use of their shield, especially when duelling%
fancy seeing another dwarf out here, what brings you to my humble home?%
any news to tell of?%
i'm quite alright, thank you%
there's a goblin shaman to the east of here, he's secluded but i'm sure he has a nice trinket stashed away%
i'm a simple dwarf, i live off the land and keep to myself%
dont get caught like i did, goblins aren't forgiving%
thanks for your help, this is not such a bad settlement%
how are you today hero?%
i heard of a lumberjack, he ran a mill in the pines north of here, i'm sure he could supply you with some wood%
surprise attacks make for a swift battle, you can finish your foe before they begin%
we could use your help%
do you need something?%
i have plenty to do myself, but speak to my brother here, he might be willing to pay you for your help.%
apparently goblins and orcs are incredibly racist. thats why you never see red and green skins mixed in the same camp%
it's not always easy, but i'm an adventurer%
i wouldnt pick a fight with a goblin fort if i wasnt prepared%
good to see you're alive%
stay clear of red goblins, they are a much tougher and nastier to the regular green skins.%
hail kin, have you come to help rid this land of goblins?%
how can i help?%
yes, a nasty bunch of them have a foothold a stone's throw away from here, you could help us rid them from the land, i'd pay for your help.%
glad to be rid of them!%
it's good to be rid of those goblins. Nasty things they are.%
some adventurers asked for my help to clear out a goblin stockade in the desert.%
we destroyed the goblin's stockade, and the adventurers are free of them once more.%
the desert breeds a tougher kind of foe, goblins and orcs are stronger and more fierce%
i'm an adventurer, nothing more.%
damn goblins have been harassing us%
here to help?%
i've got no jobs for you, but if you're looking for something to do, the ruins east of here could use some flushing out%
there are swamps south of here, nasty undead lurking about%
we've just been travelling, trying to find a place to settle, but these lands are a constant woe to us%
i saw some dwarf encampment just behind us, perhaps they could use some help%
use your shield to block projectiles, you wont suffer any damage from mere arrows%
greetings kin, i could use your help if your up for it, coin of course%
those goblins are relentless%
some ruins nearby are being inhabited by goblins, help me clear them out, i'll pay of course%
i'm glad you could help%
thanks for your help brother!%
a local soldier has asked for my help to eradicate some goblins nearby%
we exterminated the goblins, and the tower ruins are safe once more%
we've just been travelling, trying to find a place to settle, but these lands are a constant woe to us%
orcs are slower than goblins, you can use that to your advantage%
aren't there suppose to be orcs around here? be careful%
im ready to go if you are%
leave me alone, is that good enough advice?%
im so bored, there's nothing to do around here%
yeah what? you lost?%
go ask someone else%
i dont care what happens around here%
i dont do anything right now, this place is boring%
i've got no work for you, but if you want to send some dwarf to harvest, we have plenty of work to go around%
i hear the orc have a stronghold, further into the desert, where the sand turns red%
a local farmer told me about one of the large orc strongholds nearby, i've marked it on my map%
im just a farmer%
be careful when delving into holes, you never know what might come up to bite ya%
welcome traveller, this is our humble village%
can i help you?%
i have no work for you, but you're welcome to explore our old mining tunnels, they've since been infested. though%
the hordes are massing, i hear they plan to wipe out all of our kind before the dawn of a new century%
i'm a foreman,i help keep what little we have from falling down%
this is a nice little town, i wonder if they're having any problems%
how are the locals?%
i hate swamps, nothing good comes of these places%
im ready to leave%
the trees are strong here, you could harvest some good timber%
the further north we go, the more dangerous it will get, be careful%
the land looks devestated here, no doubt the work of orcs%
tread carefully kin%
orcs are tough, but they're also a lot slower, you can use that to your advantage%
greetings traveller, do you seek glory and adventure?%
stay awhile, i've got all the time of day%
i know of a powerful weapon, the orcbane, if you can slay the three orc war chiefs in this region, it is yours to wield.%
there is plenty of adventuring to do, look beyond these lands and continue your travels%
welcome hero! how may i help?%
a hermit said he will give me a powerful weapon if i can slay three of the orc war chiefs nearby%
i slayed the war chiefs, and the hermit told me the weapon is under his bed. Hopefully it is as good as he says%
i'm told the orcs have a warlord, commanding armies from his stronghold in the east.%
i'm just a simple dwarf, i admire isolation, and live happily where i choose%
there doesnt seem to be much to do here%
it's pleasant here, but i get a uneasy feeling%
this forest cant be too dangerous, there arent any goblins nearby%
have you found resources for the settlement?%
if i've learned anything lately, it isnt safe to wander around on your own%
have... have you come to save me?%
i'm so thankful! i'm forever in your debt. i'll come with you, and hopefully stay out of trouble from now on%
thank the heavens! they were going to eat me! please, i'm a trained physician, i'm sure you could use my services%
they say the continent is almost entirely overrun, i'm not sure if there are even any dwarf settlements left%
потрать время на поиски ресурсов, ты можешь найти их во многих местах, даже в тех, о которых ты мог бы и не подумать.%
кажется, у моей повозки сломалось колесо, мне нужно немного древесины, чтобы починить его, думаешь, ты сможешь мне помочь?% 
ты нашёл древесину, чтобы починить колесо?%
да, мне потребуется около 10 древесины, чтобы всё сделать, ты можешь найти её неподалёку.%
благодаря тебе я починил его в один миг.%
я починил это колесо в два счёта. а теперь, куда бы ты хотел отправиться?%
повозка сломана, понадобится около 10 древесины, чтобы починить её, возможно, я найду её неподалёку.%
повозка отремонтирована, и мы готовы продолжить наше путешествие.%
думаю, что недалеко есть хорошее местечко, где мы можем заложить наше поселение, но нам нужно добраться туда первыми.%
я - караванщик, моя работа заключается в доставке этого каравана туда, куда потребуется.%
our ancestors lived in the earth, but over the last century, nothing but foul creatures have infested the depths%
greetings adventurer, like my fellow acolytes i stand guard over our ancestoral ruins, preserving the powerful rune magic.%
only a worthy hero who is learned in the ways of runes can interact with runic architecture%
rune magic%
the rune receptacle i guard here is yet to be opened. only the ancient phrase, buried with the hero hammerhand, can open it. find it, and return here.%
one of my fellow acolytes guards ruins he found in a deep cavern. Our ancestry is rich, but richer from our time beneath the earth%
i'm a loyal follower to our tradition and ancestry. I and many other acolytes meditate on the magic runes layed down by our forefathers%
this is a rune beacon, there are many of them on this continent, and once lit, they shall reveal the entrance to the sacred treasury.%
greetings adventurer, like my fellow acolytes i stand guard over our ancestoral ruins, preserving the powerful rune magic.%
heed the wisdom of our ancestors, do not let the knowledge of dwarven rune magic to be lost forever%
i have no quests for you brave adventurer, but i would encourage you to seek knowledge of our heritage%
before our kin emerged to the surface, it is said that they built a sanctuary, sealed by the strongest runes, incase they must return for shelter.%
i'm a loyal follower to our tradition and ancestry. I, and many other acolytes, meditate to preserve the magic runes layed down by our forefathers%
many of the most powerful artifacts were sealed in rune receptacles, and can only be opened with a dwarven phrase%

this cavern seems to be void of any bipeds, which usually means wild creatures are lingering%
if this cavern is clear of foul creatures, it could provide a bountiful source of food%
 * ... woof*%
*woof woof woof*%
*woof woof*%
woof?%
*woof woof! .. woooof*%
*woof woof*%
*woof woof ... woof woof woof*%
i met a tame alpha wolf, he seems to want me to do something for him%
i helped an alpha wolf rid the orcs, stopping them from desecrating their master's burial site%
*woof ... ...*%
* ... ... woof? *%
yikes! wolves!%
these wolves gave me a scare! i dont think ive ever met a tame wolf before%
we can always salvage stone from ruins like these, our ancestors wont be needing them now, that's certain%
we're close to the desert now, these badlands mark the way no doubt about it%
have you found anymore of our kin?%
this is where i saw the goblin encampment, i wonder if they're still here%
i'm glad you're alright.%
it's quiet here, i wonder if anything lives here%
i hate the swamp%
i've seen three kobold necromancers in these swamps, i dare say, beware the third one, he is the most sinister by far.%
my brother was a mighty warrior, but he fell not long ago, but i havent been able to see his grave for quite some time.%
stay as long as you need, i dont mind the company.%
grave%
my brother's grave is in the woods, east of here. Orcs have encamped there, and i can no longer visit. if you could clear them from the site, i would be grateful.%
i'm so glad i can visit my brother again.%
greetings hero, how may i be of service?%
a hunter in the swamp asked me to clear the site of his brother's grave, so he can visit it once again%
i cleared the grave site, and the hunter rewarded me with a powerful suit of armour%
southeast of here is a cavern, it is lush and bountiful with food and supplies, but it is dangerously overrun with cave crawlers.%
south of the swamps is a cavern, apparently a great source of food, if i can exterminate the crawlers.%
i'm a hunter, i gather hides from game.%
it smells like orcs here%
i hate orcs, what they lose in brain they make up for in size%
it's cold here, this place gives me the chills%
strike a foe from behind, and you'll make them pay for their slumber%
shhh... you are bordering the glade of a band of kobold assassins, tread carefully%
keep your head on your shoulders%
assassins%
i've tracked a group of them here, i believe it's their hideout. if you're willing to help, we could clear them out together%
they are no more, thanks to you%
well met, kin%
a dwarf adventurer has requested my help in eliminating a group of kobold assassins%
i helped the assassin to kill the kobolds, he was pleased and gave me a hefty sum of 1,000 gold%
kobolds infest much of the swamps, its because not much else can stand the smell of the place%
we're getting far into the desert, we should be careful%
seen any red goblins?%
i thought there was a cotton farm nearby, but something doesnt feel right%
how goes kin?%
cave crawlers cant climb ladders, you can use that to your advantage, try not to get stuck%
greetings kin, it's good to see a friendly face%
those cave crawlers giving you trouble?%
this cavern is bountiful, and you're welcome to send workers to help harvest, if you can clear out the crawlers%
this cavern sure is lush%
this ought to be a great source of food%
quite a narrow cave entrance, but it seems to expand rather deep%
what have you found?%
it's very dense here, hard to travel around.%
good thing we havent got the wagon stuck.%
it's not in our nature to jump, but when you're facing a pack of wolves, it can do you some good to leap over their heads%
greetings kin! have you seen that monstrous beast roaming the pines?%
nasty wolves lurking about, be weary traveller, they're aggressive%
yes, a monstrous foe, a deformed soldier that leads the orcs in this region. Be careful, he is large and vicious%
that monstrosity leads an orc stronghold, north of here, closer to the frozen pines, if you find him, be careful. They call him the enslaver.%
i'm a hunter, i gather hides from game. I'm happy to orientate any workers you send, if you need skins for your settlement%
our kin were suppose to be here, i wonder if they're still here!%
what of our kin?%
this cave looks like it goes deep, watchout, you can never be certain what lies beneath the earth%
what treasure have you found?%
be careful around that librarian we have here, he's been cooped up too long, cares for nothing but books.%
welcome to our humble village traveller. We dont have a lot, but if you'd like to send workers we will accomodate them.%
we have more than we need, we'd be happy to help your settlement.%
i have plenty of labour to do, but no quests for you, i'm sorry.%
i'm a farmer, my great grandfather use to be a plump helmet farmer, until we had to come to the surface.%
i havent got any work for you, i've got plenty to do myself.%
cotton farms are often around green pine trees, for some reason they grow better.%
i help out around the farm, it's a simple life here, we're lucky we havent been bothered by anything yet.%
what a quaint little town, i wonder what the locals are like%
how are the locals? friendly?%
yeah i have some good advice for you... dont touch anything%
dont touch my books!%
keep your grubby fingers off my books you scoundrel!%
no, leave me alone, i dont want your help%
you can learn a lot from a good book%
i'm a librarian, and i keep good records of our past. dont touch anything or i'll teach you a lesson.%
this doesn't look good... i wonder if there are any survivors. I hope they put up a fight.%
have you had a look around? found any survivors?%
trolls are very slow, try hitting them from behind, and do your best to avoid getting hit.%
shhhh! i'm hiding. we were overrun a week ago, i've been hiding here since, i dare not move for fear of being caught.%
are they all gone?%
yes, these trolls came barging into our village and setup camp almost before they thought they'd gotten rid of us. Please help me, i've been stuck here for far too long.%
yes' we were overrun, but not anymore, thanks to you.%
now that i'm free of those trolls, I can get this lumberyard back up and running. Please send some workers to help.%
i found a dwarf hiding from the orcs that ransacked his village. He needs my help.%
i killed the trolls, and rescued the hiding dwarf, he's now free to rebuild his village.%
i havent heard a lot lately, i've been cooped up here too long.%
i'm a lumberdwarf, me and my brothers built this village with our bare hands.%
greetings hero! I'm glad to see you again. everything is running smoothly, thanks to your help getting rid of those trolls.%
have you anymore workers to send? felling trees is tough work.%
you've done all you can for me, it's now my turn to repay the debt.%
i'm a lumberdwarf, me and my brothers built this village with our bare hands.%
I'm packed up and heading out of here, there's no point in staying. The entire desert has been overrun with red skins.%
I'm just trying to stay out of touble. Looking for somewhere to go.%
don't mind if i do!%
I'm just trying to stay out of touble. Looking for somewhere to go.%
i found a worker fleeing the desert who wishes to join my settlment.%
he's happy to join, and seems eager to start working once again.%
looks like we've walked into trouble, as usual.%
how's it all coming along?%
at least there aren't any goblins around that i can see, i wonder what this vagabond is doing here though.%
i would recommend, from my own personal experience, to use a bucket when trying to drink from a well.%
hello? is somebody up there? oh... what a pleasant surprise. Lovely day isn't it?%
oh, you're back! i'm in quite a pickle, not an actual pickle, i mean metaphorically speaking, im actually in a well.%
lovely day%
yes, quite lovely indeed! i dont suppose you'd mind telling my friend i'm down here? i'm sure he'd have some rope to get me out.%
yes, quite lovely indeed! i dont suppose you'd mind telling my friend i'm down here? i'm sure he'd have some rope to get me out.%
Oh, you're back? what would you like to talk about? i've got all the time of day. Unless of course murn comes to get me out.%
i found gufta stuck down a well, he didnt seem too distressed.%
gufta was rather chatty, unlike his business partner.%
well... uh... i havent heard much, on the account of being stuck down this well, you see.%
when i'm not trying to get out of wells, i tend to do quite a bit of travelling, buying and selling trade goods with my joyous companion.%
give a merchant some time, they're sure to restock every now and again.%
greetings kin, have you seen gufta by any chance? For the life of me, i cant find the lazy bugger.%
has he turned up yet? i wonder where he went off to.%
gufta%
that fool went looking for some water, but probably got his head lobbed off. if you find him with it still attached, let me know so i can lob it off myself.%
well at least he isnt dead, the incompetent fool!%
interested in some wares?%
a vagabond asked me to find his friend who went looking for some water, he's apparently close by.%
i told him gufta was down the well, he was rather annoyed, and decided to leave him down there awhile.%
the red goblins have taken most of the desert land, but they refuse to live with orcs, so they stay clear of each other.%
me and my fool of a business partner travel the continent buying and selling wares. It's dangerous business nowadays.%
some items' resources are more valuable than the item itself. I hold onto wooden bucklers, they're a good source of timber.%
greetings kin! thanks for your help earlier. dont worry, he didnt leave me down there for very long.%
we've got plenty of wares for sale, take a look!%
i have plenty to do, thank you. I'll be sure to come visit your settlement sometime, if you have a depot.%
i dont pay very good attention to things... sorry, it's not in my nature. But i'm good at selling things!%
me and my brilliant business partner travel the continent buying and selling wares. It's incredibly fun.%
give a merchant some time, they're sure to restock every now and again.%

red skins are around, i can smell them from a mile away, nasty creatures.%
i'm ready to leave the moment you are.%
welcome to the lost city of glomerate, home of our great ancestor, obuk the steelclad%
rune magic takes a thousand years to fade, and even then it will often linger with usefulness%
thank goodness! they were going to eat me!%
you've done plenty already.%
my friends went to start a settlement in a cavern nearby, i'm going to go look for them.%
i'm a miner, and thankfully, not someone's dinner!%
greetings adventurer, we could use your help.%
that orc is a complete nuisance, is he gone yet?%
two orcs have footed themselves up in those ruins, and we cant get them down. They're a deadshot, be careful.%
good thing you came along, we'd be filled with crossbow bolts otherwise.%
greetings hero, how can i be of service?%
some dwarf soldiers are having trouble with two orcs sniping them from atop some ruins.%
the dwarves were happy for my help, and some of them have joined the settlement.%
me and my men have banded together, we're on a mission to conquer the continent!%
not I, ask our commander, he'd be paying for help, i'm sure.%
i'm keeping guard here.%
i wonder whats going on over here.%
i could use a drink.%
speak with our commander, he'll tell you what's going on.%
we're bringing the fight back to the horde!%
i have no work for you, i shouldn't even leave my post.%
i help keep our small town from being overrun. i stand guard against our foes%
our ancient ruins have many treasures, hidden by rune magic. Take your time investigating them.%
greetings kin, welcome to our humble settlement. we have our troubles, but we still get by.%
we wish to return to the earth, like our ancient brethren, to conquer the subterranean lands once again.%
the caverns around us are infested with cave crawlers, the source is nearby, if you can eradicate them, ill reward you for the help.%
we dont have too many troubles now, thanks to you.%
our settlement is much safer now, thanks to you.%
a dwarf in an underground settlement asked me to clear a crawler infestation.%
i cleared the ifnestation and was rewarded with gold and renown.%
many centuries of our idling has lead to breeding of more sinister and foul beasts to populate beneath us.%
i'm the leader of this settlement. I offer wisdom and counsel to our kin.%
thanks for your help,  those trolls would of eaten me by now.%
it's good to see you again, stay awhile.%
i dont have any work for you, sorry.%
speak to our leader, i'm sure he'll have work for you.%
i'm an engraver and stone mason.%
be careful, even if you kill a troll, they might collapse ontop of you!%
greetings kin, if you're looking for work i might have something for you.%
have you seen my old friend murn by any chance?%
a friend of mine went missing not long ago, i think he was snatched by some trolls. If you find him, please let me know.%
you've done enough for me, thank you.%
it's good to be with close friends again.%
a miner asked me to find his friend, he believes he was captured by trolls.%
the miner and his friend were reunited, and thankful for my help.%
i hear the trolls like to stay in caverns near the edge of the mountain ranges, they pillage nearby settlements regularly.%
i mine what we need to keep our settlement going.%
i have no work for you, i shouldn't even leave my post.%
i help keep our small town from being overrun. i stand guard against our foes%
speak to our leader, i'm sure he'll have work for you.%
i've been exploring these caverns, finding fertile soil for mushroom farming.%
this place looks uninhabited, i wonder if there is a good sources of minerals nearby.%
its awfully thick in here, watch your feet.%
this palce wreaks of troll, we best be getting out of here.%
we really should leave, the odour here is thick enough to taste.%
need a workshop.... need a workshop...%
tree... life... stone...%
i need cloth... jewels... bone... huh!? go away!%
strange mood%
it needs to... yes... menace with spikes... spikes of.... spikes of cloth!%
*mumble mumble*%
occupation?... i'm.... i will be.... i'll be a legendary craftdwarf!%
i like the pines, the colors are always nice.%
there are often wolves around here.%
send some workers, i have plenty of work to go around if you're in need of timber.%
greetings adventurer! i sure could use some help with my last visitor.%
i heard him mumbling about crafting something that menaced with spikes. no idea what he was on about.%
visitor%
a dwarf stopped for a visit, a lone adventurer. Suddenly he went stark mad, raving about needing a workshop. Now he's cooped up in the house, after trashing this one.%
i'm glad i dont have any crazy guests any more.%
greetings kin, all is well.%
a lumberdwarf has a problem with a resident who apparently lost his mind.%
i killed the crazed resident, and the problem seems to be resolved.%
there are orcs near this area, but the tundras further north have a blue kind of orc, nastier and more sinister.%
im a lumberdwarf, i fell trees. You can send help, i'll supply you with timber if you need.%
aggressive foes will often spot you before others.%
sorry, i dont have any work for you.%
me and my companions are on a hunting expedition. My brother trades our hides for merchandise, you can speak with him.%
i get a strange feeling about this place, like something is beneath me.%
these woods dont feel safe.%
take a look at my wares, see if there's anything you fancy.%
i'm quite alright, thank you. But i have some wares if you're interested.%
there's a nasty goblin shaman about, i saw him practicing his fiery arts. Be careful.s%
i'm the brains behind our group, i buy and sell hides and have a small merchant business on the side.%
it's better to have an aggressive archer, they wont hesitate when shooting.%
i dont have any work for you, but you could see where these goblins keep coming from. They seem to pop out of the ground.%
i'm a hunter, me and my companions move about on hunting expeditions.%
it's wonderful here, lush and peaceful.%
i wouldnt mind staying here for awhile.%
they say, the presence of the lepus regina attracts its weaker and inferior relatives. The regular lepus, which we enjoy quite frequently in stew...%
greetings adventurer, tread carefully, you are on sacred ground. These stones mark the sanctuary of the ancient lepus regina.%
the great lepus regina is said to be the quickest and most cunning of foes, and also very zealous for it's brethren.%
i have no quests for you brave adventurer, but i would encourage you to seek out more of the rune beacons, and mark the way to our lost hearths.%
some believe the great lepus still lives, hidden away in the northen breaches. But can only be summoned by provocation.%
wolves cannot climb, that's why we stow away in here.%
there is plenty to do, i'm sure. Speak with hurick.%
i'm on watch.%
i thought there were some ruins around here, i wonder what happened.%
i wonder who might have taken up residence in these ruins.%
wolves dont hesitate, you're better off crushing them as quick as you can, before they overwhelm you.%
greetings kin, i do believe i've heard of your settlement, it's becoming legend in these parts. Would you care to offer us aid?%
if you can help us, i'm sure i can convince me and my men to join your settlement.%
we're regular labourers, but we've had to stockade ourselves in here, so the wolves can't get to us. They're being led by an orc marksman, deal with him, and we'll be free to join you.%
we're forever in your debt, i'll rally my men and meet you back at your settlment.%
you've done us a great service, i'll rally my men and meet you at your settlement.%
some workers need my help to kill an orc who is apparently sending wolves out after them.%
the labourers have decided to join my settlement.%
there isnt much to do around here, we've harvested what we can.%
i'm a simple labourer, but i've assumed position as leader over these men, to help us stay together, away from these wolves.%
i've seen some orc crossbow deadshots. Keep your shield up, they'll hit you between the eyes otherwise. %
greetings lad, here to help us out?%
is that orc still alive? i do hope not.%
speak to hurick here, he'll tell you what troubles us.%
other than regular labouring and hauling, i can been a building designer from time to time.%
wolves cannot climb, that's why we stow away in here.%
there is plenty to do, i'm sure. Speak with hurick.%
i'm on watch.%
what a dank cave this is. But you never know what might be a good source of minerals.%
it's quiet here. Have you had any trouble?%
be careful, trolls have been spotted in the mountains, they use caves to hide from the sunlight.%
be weary traveller, this cavern is filled with foul beasts, i just lost my brother but a day ago.%
have you rid the cavern of those foul creatures?%
my brother opened a cavern down below, but it is filled with a foul breed of slugs. He escaped, but he was poisoned, and not long it got to his heart, and he died here in my arms.%
i'm glad those things are gone. they're an ungodly breed of slug i wish never to see again.%
i'm very thankful for your efforts, if only you'd come sooner before i lost my brother.%
a miner opened a cavern and lost his brother to beastly slugs. he needs my help.%
i cleared the cavern of the slugs, and the miner can now resume work.%
my uncle said, being poisoned is like being drunk, you get slower and heavier the worse you get.%
this use to be a mining settlement, centuries ago. These mineshafts are rich in mineral ore.%
i have no quests for you brave adventurer, i only stand guard over such ruins as these.%
most rune receptacles like this must be opened by a phrase or sequence.%
i've never seen a cave like this before, it's intriguing. They say different mushrooms grow in different mineral rich environments. %
these red mushrooms look quite sturdy, they could probably hold your weight.%
the land looks devestated here, no doubt the work of orcs/%
tread carefully kin.%
i think i can still walk, thank you!%
this is where those miners said they were going, i wonder if they made it here alright.%
how are the miners?%
slugs can't do lasting damage, if you run off, you can catch your breath and try again. But these slugs will set you on fire! be careful.%
hello once again adventurer, it seems we've run out of luck once again. This cavern seems to be filled to the brim with fire slugs.%
nasty slugs, have you gotten rid of them yet?%
fire slugs%
yes, a nasty breed for sure, they've infested these caverns, we could really use some help getting rid of them, we'd join your settlement if you could help.%
i sure am glad they're gone. me and my crew will meet you back at your settlement.%
greetings hero! you've saved us once again. How can i help you?%
the miners need me to clear out the cave of fire slugs.%
the miners have decided to join my settlement because of my help towards them.%
no one really know where cave slugs come from, they just sort of appear on their own.%
i'm a miner by trade, the earth is where we belong.%
being caught on fire is nasty business. It burns rapidly. much faster than poison.%
we sure picked a bad spot to start mining.%
hail kin, are you here to help?%
speak to urist here, he'll tell you of our troubles.%
i heard blue orcs are actually grey, but we call them blue because they live in the snow.%
i'm a miner by trade, the earth is where we belong.%
i can see some ruins ahead, but they look occupied. Careful, there are many orcs this far north.%
have you seen any orcs?%
we're still close to the swamps, but i have a feeling we're up against something nastier than before.%
what vile things lurk near here?%
watchout for those purple spear throwing kobolds, they throw two at a time, the devilish lizards!%
welcome to the foulest place you'll ever lay eyes on, kin. Perhaps you could help us remove the taint of this place.%
something unusual about these creatures, they aren't natural. I would bet my beard some foul sorcerer is giving them unnatural abilities nearby.%
enraged kobolds, a mass of them, a stone's throw away from here. They're being led by a lesser shaman. If you deal with him, we can handle the others, i'll reward you of course.%
exterminate all the taint you find, kin!%
hail hero! what services do you require?%
olob has asked me to assassinate the shaman close by.%
olob rewarded my efforts, and can now deal with the rest of the kobolds.%
magic is thick in the air here, something lingers in this region, i dare not seek it out without a proper army.%
im an adventurer, my friend mur here aids me on my quest to slay the taint of these lands.%
these adventurers look sturdy, i wonder if they would need our help, though.%
what treasures have you found?%
poison is nasty business, it seeps through your armour at the worst of times.%
greetings kin, these foul lands are infested with enraged kobolds, beware!%
some foul magic at work here, no doubt about it.%
join you? sorry, building a settlement above ground is dwarven blasphemy. I'll only join a stronghold beneath the ground, like a true dwarf.%
i believe the foul creatures here are being imbued by magic of some sort, i'm not sure where it comes from.%
i'm an adventurer, me and olob are on a quest to slay the putrid taint of the overland.%

those kobolds have spotted us by now, surely, but they dont seem to be aggressive. how odd.%
i wonder what these kobolds are about.%
i feel the uneasy feeling of magic nearby.%
this place smells terrible, lets go.%
these ruins have an eerie presence of magic. I feel cold just being here.%
this place is unsettling.%
this is a desolate landscape, whoever lives here must truly hate trees.%
i never liked trees much myself.%
dont leave any trees standing, these overland creatures can suffer for all I care. Before you know it, elves will start popping out of the ground.%
greetings kin! this is ma'home. I'm getting ready for the new exodus.%
cut down as many trees as you can, they'e good for nothing, burn the lot of em.%
exodus%
i'll be leading an expedition back into the heart of the earth, just as soon as i get some followers. But a nasty orc mage has been bothering me. If you take care of him it'll attract more followers for me.%
good riddens for that orc, now more dwarves will surely flock to join my cause!%
i need to clear the forest, it's just getting in the way. Clear it all down.%
a stubborn old miner asked me to kill an orc mage close by.%
the miner was happy that i'd killed the mage, and rewarded me with precious... stone.%
well i heard you have a settlement, above ground of all things. Blasphemy! we belong beneath the ground, not above it!%
i'm a miner, and a stone mason, i dont craft anything out of inferior materials, such as.... er, wood.%
great and powerful artefacts have been locked away with rune magic. If we lose the knowledge of our ancestors, we may also lose our strength.%
i have no quests for you brave adventurer, but if you find the correct sequence to these runes, i would be most impressed.%
one of my kin has great knowledge in rune phrases. He may have the answer to these ruins. He resides to the south, beyond the greater lake.%
an acolyte told me of his friend who might know the answer to a rune guarded treasure.%
our ancient runes run deep into our cuture and heritage, but it's such a mystery to us now. It's a shame a lot of it has been lost.%
can you feel that?... there must be dwarven runes nearby.%
would you look at tht, i heard about sentinels that our ancestors created to guard sacred runes, but i never thought i'd see one.%
can you hear that? the sentinel makes a light humming noise. Apparently only dwarves can hear it.%
      . . . . . .%
*hummmmmmmmmmmm*%
*hummmmmmmmmm*%
      . . . . . .%
      . . . . . .%
      . . . . . .%
if you have any sense at all, you'll figure it out on your own.%
oi! what are you doing here? you want to know the secrets to runes?! bah, never, they're sacred, i'll never disclose them to the likes of you.%
runes are sacred, and they hold the keys to our history, you cant go putting your grubby fingers on them.%
i'd never share any runes... well, hang on, maybe you can help me. That sentinel over there has been driving me crazy, constant humming. If you can disable it, maybe i'll share something with you.%
can't you read? it's right there you goose!%
well, i hope that sequence helps, from what i gather, it should activate a set of ruins somewhere in the north.%
a senile acolyte wants me to dismantle a nearby sentinel.%
the acolyte showed me a phrase to be used on some ruins far north of here.%
i have many untold secrets... but none for you, dont ask me again.%
isn't it obvious what i do? can you not clearly see by what im wearing that i'm an acolyte? get you eyes checked.%
dont engage a sentinel, although built by our ancestors, they'll attack anything hostile towards it.%
hello kin, dont suppose you know much about runes? i could use a spot of luck right about now.%
he looks so helpless over there...%
my brother got himself stuck on the other side of this pitt, i bet these runes have some way of making safe passage, but i dont know how to use them.%
it's a good thing you came along when you did.%
you've done us a great favour, thanks again kin.%
a miner's friend got stuck on an opposite ledge, and needs my help getting him down.%
i rescued the miner, and opened up another part of the cave.%
i heard that some runes use the same pattern for similar uses.%
me and my brother have been miners all our lives, but it's been getting increasingly dangerous lately.%
you could explore further down here, it looks interesting, but i'd be careful, i tihnk i saw some sentinels. They creep me out.%
oh thank goodness you're here. I was beginning to worry i'd never get down at all. i'm not even sure how i got here to be honest.%
i've got a terrible memory, have we met?%
oh, you've done enough already. I'm not sure how i got here to be honest... i'm often getting myself stuck in the strangest places.%
my brother and i are miners, always have been, always will.%
it seems we've found some more ruins.%
i wonder what we could find here.%
dont stand still, that sentinel is a deadshot.%
that sentinel is raving made, how as i suppose to know it'd go crazy if i tried to move a few stones around?%
is it still there? those things are terrifying.%
oh, yes we could use your help, speak to menam here, i'm sure he'd be willing to pay.%
sentinels were suppose to protect us and our kin, centuries ago, but they sure feel like they do the opposite.%
me and my friend here are... well, i suppose we're scavengers, i often carry a few trinkets around, Interested? i'm also handy with my tools, if you need something fixed.%
the ambience here is quite serene, i could stay awhile.%
can you hear a humming noise?%
try not to die, it's bad for you.%
hello kin, know much about sentinels? we could use some help if you're looking for some coin.%
the last adventurer who came by got toaste... err... decided to give this quest a miss.%
my friend here accidentally activated a sentinel. It turned red and started blasting at us. If you can get rid of it, we'd pay you for your trouble.%
you've helped enough, good thing to, that sentinel could have vaporised us both.%
we can finally start looting these ruins, it looks to be full of good stone and who knows what might be buried beneath it.%
journal entry beginning quest%
journal entry finishing quest%
there is an unusual acolyte nearby, he might be able to help you on your adventures.%
me and my friend are scavengers, we find what we can and sell it off. There is much to be found hidden away on this continent.%
i wonder what could be around here.%
these pines will be a good source of timber.%
tragic what happened here. it does make you wonder though.%
it'd be nice to restore this town.%
i'm alright, thank you.%
greetings kin, i can't seem to get over that wall there, i'd need some stone to help get one of us over.%
would you care to donate some stone?%
if you give me 500 stone, i'll build a ramp so you can get over, you can help yourself to anything over there, but the stone is mine.%
a fair deal, no takebacks.%
did you find anything interesting?%
a miner asked me to tribute him 500 stone to help me get over a wall.%
i gave him the 500 stone to see what i could find.%
i'm a stone mason, i've been moving around for quite some time, looking for a place to settle down and start a business.%
greetings fellow dwarf, we're just travellers like yourself, and we've come accross some interesting remnants.%
i'm seeing if i can restore this house, it seems like a nice place to settle down. But i dont tihnk i'll need your help.%
im a lumberdwarf by trade, but i've been migrating for the past few weeks. My friend borel over there is more ambitious.%
this smells like goblins, i didnt think there were any goblins down this far south.%
there are goblins everywhere around here, they stink up the place.%
well met kin, fancy a blade or bludgeon for your battles?%
i hve a few good items for sale, care to have a look?%
i have plenty of work, but none for ye.%
blacksmith, isn't it obvious?%
i have no work for you lad, but i'm sure someone around here would have an odd job or two.%
i'm the innkeeper, i keep everyone's thirst at bay.%
there is still powerful magic lingering in our ancestors' ruins, you should look carefully wherever you go.%
welcome to our humble library. I know the locals care not for our history, but someone must take care of it.%
i wish i had more literature, it's a shame to lose so much of our history.%
there are some scribings on the ruins near here, but of course, it's much too dangerous for the likes of me. If you could tell me what it is, i'd be most thankful.%
i'm fascinated by our history, please tell me if you find anything interesting.%
greetings hero! come to peruse my library?%
a town librarian asked me to find runes scribed on one of the nearby ruins.%
i informed the librarian of the runes, and he will investigate them further.%
i read that some of our ancestors used to be immortal, and time could not kill them. I wonder what changed.%
i'm the town's librarian, although, i admit i'm not as welcome here as i'd like.%
it's often better to leave sentinels alone, like the one up there, we've allowed it to stay unhindered, and it attacks any hostiles that try to raid us.%
greetings traveller, welcome to our humble village. We're confined to our town, the dangers around us dont allow us to expand.%
the sentinel here protects us, thankfull, so long as we dont disturb it.%
i have no work for you young adventurer.%
i hear some caverns are a lush source of food, much better than above ground.%
i'm a farmer, i keep our village well fed, with what little space we have for land.%
this is a nice little town, i wonder if they're having any troubles.%
how are the locals doing?%
i have nothing for you to do, sorry.%
be weary of blue skins, they're quick, hardy and violent.%
greetings kin, news of your settlement has spread, it is pleasing to finally meet you.%
we are a humble village, we have little to offer, and are under constant threat.%
Thankfully we are relatively safe due to that sentinel over there, but blue skin goblins have built a stronghold here, and threaten our existence, if you can, please rid us of them.%
i'm astonished at your incredible abilities, i couldnt be more thankful for your help thus far.%
you are most welcome here hero.%
a town leader asked me to eradicate the nearby fort of goblins.%
the leader was ecstatic, and rewarded me well.%
i heard of blue skins before, but thought they only resided in the northern frontier.%
i'm the town leader, i keep the order here, and give counsel.%
it's hard to sneak up on a wolf, but if you do, they dont stand a chance.%
oh thank goodness,  i've been trapped up here for days. That druid has been sending out wolves for months, they're relentless.%
that druid, oh, what a pest, he wont leave me alone.%
druid%
yes, lousy nut, somewhere in the forests south of here, if you find him, exterminate him for me, i'll reward you with one of my special trinkets.%
glad he's gone, the devilish lad.%
good riddens, that druid was a no good traitor anyway.%
an old hermit living in a tower asked me to kill a druid nearby.%
i killed the druid and the hermit rewarded me with an artefact of sorts.%
the ruins around these parts are still rich, full of uselful artefacts.%
wouldn't you like to know...%
is that a house over there? what an odd place for someone to live.%
strange, someone living out here, did you meet them?%
there sure are a lot of ruins around here, if they're not too dangerous, we ought to have a good look around.%
i wonder if there are any rare artefacts laying around.%
these must be the wilds of the druid, i heard he is a master of beasts, but not in any seeming way.%
watchout, they say the druid has unatural woo over creatures.%
never underestimate common beasts. With a simple enchantment or spell, a mere wolf can behave like  worg.%
well met kin, i would advise you to be cautious, as these wilds are cursed with the druid's sickly magic.%
be on your toes, and stay alert, those creatures are sneaky.%
i was going to pack up and leave this forsaken forest, but i lost my favourite quiver. It's surrounded by nasty crawlers, summoned by the druid no doubt. if you kill them, i can search for it.%
i'll look for my quiver now that it's safe, thanks again for your help.%
well met kin! how may i be of service?%
a hunter wants to leave the forest, but creatures are stopping him from doing so.%
i killed the creatures and the hunter is free to look for his quiver.%
i hear the druid moves about, from place to place, if you find him, be weary of his minions.%
i've been hunting in these wilds for a long time, but i do believe it's time i moved on, this druid has poisoned the entire forest.%
we're very far south, i have never been here before.%
i feel uneasy about this place.%
i feel uneasy about this place, it feels... too green.%
is that hemp growing? yuck!%
it's dense here, prime location for timber.%
too much green here, it's making me sick.%
sometimes i get the urge to cut down a tree, but i've learned to suppress those evil desires by receiving thrashings.%
i have so much to learn from our brothers seeking the druid ways.%
i wish to learn more about gishlain, and his great attunement to nature.%
gishlain%
he was a famous dwarf ancestor with an affinity for nature, we believe he is the cornerstone of our doctrine, to love greenery, and help things to grow.%
we seek the anthropias druid, he is somewhere in these forests, we hope to come under his leadership.%
we are followers of gishlain, and seek to be apprenticed by the anthropias druid, who is said to have a powerful affinity with nature.%
do not destroy anything that grows, all life is precious, and we must not seek our own greedy gain over the life of the green.%
greetings adventurer, have you come to follow the ways of gishlain as well?%
we are followers of gishlain, his wise teachings tell us of how to conduct ourselves, to love the things that grow.%
gishlain%
he was a famous dwarf ancestor with an affinity for nature, we believe he is the cornerstone of our doctrine, to love greenery, and help things to grow.%
i hear the anthropias druid is powerful and understanding in nature, we are seeking him, and wish to follow after him.%
we are followers of gishlain, and seek to be apprenticed by the anthropias druid, who is said to have a powerful affinity with nature.%
it's not entirely in dwarven nature to love green things, but it's our duty to repent of our greedy and life-hating ways.%
i love the tree canopy, the beautiful greenery. It use to make be barf, but now, it only makes me slightly nauseous.%
we are followers of gishlain, his wise teachings tell us of how to conduct ourselves, to love the things that grow.%

we are followers of gishlain, and seek to be apprenticed by the anthropias druid, who is said to have a powerful affinity with nature.%
be careful, they may look harmless and pathetic, but they can sure pack a punch.%
please... help me... kill these blasted abominations, it's torture, i can't bare to watch any longer.%
they're.... they're green-lovers! what a nightmare...%
abominations%
it's sickening, these dwarves cracked, they think they have an affinity for... err. nature, yuck. Please put them out of their misery, and help me get out of here.%
i thought it was tall tales, but here, with my own eyes i've seen it happen, dwarves turning into green-lovers. It makes me sick.%
i feel nauseous just thinking about these grreen-lovers. I'm going to dig a hole, and i'm not coming back to see daylight ever again.%
a miner was captured by green loving dwarves and asked me to rescue him.%
i rescued the dwarf from the green-lovers.%
i was a miner, before these sick creatures captured me, they've been trying to force me to eat green rubbish and wear hemp.%
these ruins are quite large, we could be here awhile.%
fond anything interesting?%
another set of ruins, there seem to be a lot around here.%
it's quiet here, perhaps these ruins haven't been overrun like the others.%
found any artefacts lying around?%
not underestimate ogrek, he long time war chief.%
ogrek old, and not want to sick and die slow, like worm. Duel ogrek, dwarf! if you thinks you worthy.%
do you wants to duel? ogrek not living forever.%
ogrek is ready, attack! and we see who is toughest.%
stop wasting ogreks time.%
war chief ogrek, northern tribes, but ogrek old, and wants duel, not sick and old.%
it seems those dwarves are on the move!%
how's the battle coming along?%
stick with us, you'll be safe!%
we're on a mission to conquer the badlands!%
goblins dont stand a chance against us!%
join us in our conquest, leave no goblin alive!%
i hear only the voice of our leader!%
we're a band of adventurers, on a mission to wipe out goblin-kind.%

we're a band of adventurers, on a mission to wipe out goblin-kind.%
looks like more red skins up ahead, be careful, it looks like they're trying to fortify themselves.%
the red goblins seem persistent on occupying the desert, they must see it as their territory.%
i'm a deadshot with a bow.%
keep your distance from blue goblins, they're nasty.%
i dont have any jobs, sorry.%
im an adventurer, we're just trying to stay alive right now.%
this looks like trouble, be careful.%
blue skins shouldnt be this far south, they belong in the snow fields north of here, i dont like this.%
just keep breathing, you're doing alright so far.%
i hope this barricade holds.%
i'm ready for battle at a moment's notice. What do you want?%
i dont have any jobs for you, sorry. But you're welcome to give us a hand. Goblins could be at our throats at any moment.%
it's not safe around here, dont wander off alone.%
i use to be a town guard, but now we're adventurers.%
stay on guard!%
we are never safe from goblins!%
i dont have ny jobs for you.%
i really dont have time.%
i'm an adventurer.%
funny seeing you here. Well, you might as well give us a hand.%
if you're alive, you're doing better than most of us.%
i have no jobs, sorry lad. We're barely holding together, i havent got time to give out contracts.%
i've been leading this band of adventurers for awhile now, but we can barely keep it together with all these blue skins around.%
yuck, too much green here, lets get going.%
so much green... makes me feel... sick.%
watchout, these wolves are no regular canine. They've been imbued by the anthropias druid, they have a magical nature to them.%
speak to urist there, he'll have work for you.%
i'm normally a lumberdwarf, but lately, i've had to help fight off wolves.%
wolves can't climb, that's why we stay up here.%
greetings traveller, stay above the ground, there are wolves around these parts.%
nasty wolves, it's almost like they knew we were trying to cut down this green rubbish.%
yes, if you get rid of them, i'll pay you, so we can get back to cutting down this sickly green place.%
i'm glad you got rid of them.%
greetings hero, fine day, how can i help you?%
a lumberdwarf asked me to kill the wolves nearby, so he can continue felling.%
i killed the wolves and he rewarded me with timber and gold.%
i hear a druid controls these unseemly woods, a sick creature, with a love for green things.%
im a lumberdwarf, i hate trees, cutting them down is the only thing that brings me joy.%
this place seems interesting, quiet at the least.%
amazing, it looks like a dwarven settlement use to be here.%
this place is barren of any plant life, which means it must be dwarven.%
first you must dossolve powerful enchantments in order to learn them, and imbue them onto other items.%
greetings adventurer, do you seek the knowledge of our ancestors? speak with me, and i will tell you what i know.%
heed the wisdom of our ancestors, do not let the knowledge of dwarven rune magic to be lost forever.%
our ancestors are from the earth, they built a passage way that connected the great expanse of the deep to the surface, but it now remains hidden. would you like to know more?%
once all twelve beacons are lit, the passage way to the great expanse will be revealed, and we can return to our home and hearth.%
there are many other ruins like these among the land, much of our history still awaits to be uncovered.%
the acolyte in the mountain told me about the twelce sanctuary beacons.%
if i light all twelve of the beacons, it will reveal the location to the great depths.%
the runeforge, like the one before us, was a powerful construction used to imbue powerful rune magic into items. Observe the one before us and learn to build one for yourself.%
the acolyte told me to observe this runeforge to learn how to build one for myself.%
i'm a loyal follower to our tradition and ancestry. I, and many other acolytes, meditate to preserve the magic runes layed down by our forefathers.%
this is where the second beacon is? it doesnt look safe, red goblins by the looks of it.%
have you found the beacon?%
this is why we ought to live underground, to keep away from this horrid cold weather.%
i'm gonna stay here, i get the feeling it's becoming very dangerous around these parts.%
be careful! it looks like blue skins are here.%
ready to go? i sure am!%
your shield wont do you much good against a raging ball of fire, you're better off trying to dodge it.%
i've just been chased out of my mining site by a bunch of carnivorous flora. Bad time for business it seems.%
i can fix up your gear if ya'need. Anything to keep my mind off the daylight, i just want to get back underground.%
yep, not far from here, think you could clear it out for me? i'd pay you well, of course.%
i'm glad to be back on track, now i just need to find a palce to trade hard earned ore.%
good to see you again friend! we ought to grab a pint some day!%
a miner in a northern town asked me to clear out his mining site which became overrun.%
i've cleared out his mining site, and he rewarded me generously.%
they say our kin use to live far below the earth, much further down than i've been, in great expansive caverns.%
i'm a miner, i setup a decent site not far from here, before i got chased out.%
dont hesitate with wolves, they wont do you the favour.%
i'm busy, best you move on.%
eh? i'm just on duty, gotta keep a sharp eye out, no time for chit chat.%
dont hesitate with wolves, they wont do you the favour.%

worgs are heavy, but they make for good furring.%
aye, welcome to death's grip on this continent, are ye lookin' fer some work?%
we ain't got a wolf problem... we got ourselves a worg problem.%
there's an infamous worg about, a black burly canine, not far from here. Travellin'snot safe with him about, coin for it's life.%
you've done plenty, i got nuf'n for yer.%
aye, traveller, how's the road treating you?%
a hunter is offering coin for the death of a black worg nearby.%
i killed the black worg, and he rewarded me in pelts and coin.%
there's packs of worgs roaming the frozen lakes, hoping for an easy feed, best be watchin yer'self%
hunter, leatherworker, and town guard when needed.%
wolves are devilishly quick, you'd be daft to try and power hit'em. Dont relent, hold yer'shield up, then hack'em as they pass.%
hark! welcome to our humble home young traveller, ye must have yer wits about you, especially when dealing with blue skins.%

the snow'll be slave to'ye hero, you're mighty as ever, blue skins will put their tail between their legs when they hear yer name.%

a town chief asked me to eradicate a nearby blue skin camp.%
i cleared out the blue skin camp and was rewarded generously.%
yeti's bin'roamin about lately, they're harmless, at first, but dont test'em.%
i'm the chieftan ere, kin are strong together, and i be the link for our little community.%
what a relief to find a settlement so far from home. they sure must be sturdy to handle this weather.%
how are the locals? strong folk i bet.%
dont hesitate with wolves, they wont do you the favour.%

this weather is unpleasant at best, and i can be sure it's occupants wont be any nicer.%
er, rotten cold, let's move on.%
some beacons are very difficult to get to, but others might be somewhat easier.%
greetings adventurer, this receptacle has been locked for centuries. It can only be opened by knowing the correct phrase, buried with argothias.%
if you wish to open this receptacle, seek out the rune phrase spoken by argothias.%
treasure room%
yes, i thought that'd get your attention. This beacon here is one of seven, and when they're all lit, these ruins will reveal the location of the sacred treasure room.%
there are many beacons laid down by our forefathers, but they all serve a unique purpose.%
some beacons are very difficult to get to, but others might be somewhat easier.%
greetings adventurer, you are standing on a holy site of our ancestors. this site guards a sanctuary cove of treasure.%
greetings adventurer, you are standing on a holy site of our ancestors. this site guards a sanctuary room of treasure.%
treasure room%
yes, i thought that'd get your attention. This beacon here is one of many, and when they're all lit, these ruins will reveal the location of the sacred treasure room.%
there are many beacons laid down by our forefathers, but they all server a unique purpose.%
hear that? it sounds like wolves are nearby.%
let me know when you want to leave, we may need to high tail it out of hear.%
looks like a pretty large fort up ahead, think you can handle that kind of thing?%
yes? ready to go?%
it's tempting to open a chest or peruse through some paraphernalia, but be patient, lest you draw attention to yourself.%
psst, oI! keep your head down, there's a vicious gang of orc mages about. they'll cut you down before you can blink.%
i'm offering a reward, my favourite dagger, that's if you can deliver, of course.%
orc mages%
three, just ahead. Like nothing i've ever seen. I can't get to them. If you can catch them by surprise, i'll pay you handsomely for your efforts.%
most dwarves can't stop being noisy, but you... you have a true gift of being un-noisy.%
i'll have to stop by your settlement some time for a drink. I've never seen a dwarf capable of being so un-noisy, most impressive.%
a dwarf assassin has asked me to sneak up and slay three orc mages nearby.%
i slayed the mages, and was given an enchanted dagger for payment.%
blue goblins have made their way to the southern part of the continent, but no one knows how they got here.%
that's my business, you should only be concerned with the job i'm offering.%
it seems quiet here, see what you can find.%
i dont wander much further north than this, it's dangerous, the icy wilds are full of nasty creatures.%
hello fellow traveller, i stumbled upon these runes not long ago, i've been wondering what they're about.%
any idea what these runes are for? ... neither do i.%
i'm not sure what they're about, but i found em, so i think whatever they have hidden away belongs to me.%
those acolytes around the continent, they seem to know a whole lot about runes and stuff, you should talk to them.%
i'm a hunter, i gather hides and explore where i can.%
oh bother, first it was the brewery incident, now this, they'll have my head... huh?! oh sorry, i was talking to myself.%
thank my beard you're here! i've run into a spot of bad luck, and some black blood orcs have chased me out of my ruins!%
i really hope you can take care of those orcs, otherwise they'll throw me out of the order, i'm certain of it.%
black bloods%
we're close to one of their strongholds, and they've taken up residence now in the ruins i was suppose to be guarding. think you can handle'em?%
i'm so glad you got rid of them, hopefully no one finds out what happened.%
hello again! i'm awfully happy you're here! what would you like to talk about?%
a dwarf acolyte asked me to get rid of the orcs that kicked him out of his ruins.%
i got rid of the orcs, and he gave me everything he had... 2 coins.%
well uh, if you're looking for more ruins, one of my friends guards a fancy rune chest or something, on the fringe of the desert, south of here.%
i'm an acolyte... although, if anyone gets wind of my failings here, i might not be for much longer.%
the sands here are red, i hear it's a dangerous place to be.%
the rocks around here make it difficult to travel.%
we're at the very bottom of the continent, this is an interesting place for ruins.%
anything fancy lying about?%
if you hide in a barrel, make sure you dont eat supper in it as well... you might get yourself stuck.%
pssssst, OI! come here, yeah you. I'm talking to you. What? no im not a talking barrel you fool, i'm hiding in here!%
i think i'm stu.... nevermind, no i'm alright.%
there are a bunch of forest trolls building a fort here, that's why i'm hiding. I dont want to be eaten. Think you can handle them?%
i was hiding, yes, but now i think i'm stuck. Do you have any butter by any chance?%
hello again, have you... uhm, got anything greasy i could borrow?%
a dwarf in a barrel wants me to get rid of some nearby trolls.%
i got rid of the forest trolls, but i think the dwarf in the barrel is stuck...%
i heard the blue skins came down this end of the continent through some elaborate cave system underground.%
i'm an expert sneaker, i'm the stealthiest dwarf you'd ever know... but i'm a little out of my league at the moment.%
weary steps, it appears to be an orc stronghold, desecrating our ancestors' ruins no doubt.%
this must be where the orc stronghold is, be weary, i hear they are lead by a monstrosity.%
you should get some more help, you should'nt do this alone.%
watch your step, otherwise you might find yourself in my shoes.%
oh thank my beard you're here, i thought i was done for, that insane miner wont do anything but dig holes. do you have anything to eat?%
i've been stuck down here awhile, think you can help?%
i busted my leg when i fell down this ruddy hole, if you could spare 500 food, my companions ought to find me soon enough.%
i'm very grateful, truly. That crazy miner up there, however, can get himself eaten for all i care.%
thanks for your help, i'm sure my friends will come around some time soon. I just hope it doesn't rain.%
a traveller fell down a hole and broke his leg, he's asked for some food.%
i gave him some food and he returned the favor with a fine blade.%
the northern wilds are overrun, there's no good trade routes there anymore.%
i'm a merchant, i've been travelling about lately trying to find a new trade route.%
silly fools keep falling down my holes, goblins, trolls, rabbits, everything. Watch your step.%
eh? hey! you think you can steal my treasure out from under my nose? not on my watch you thief!%
if you see anything shiny, keep your hands off, it belongs to me!%
i buried it here somewhere, i must remember... yes, somewhere... i need to find it, perhaps i buried it over there...%
wouldn't you like to know... eavesdropper, i'm not telling you my secrets.%
i'm a miner! But not a coal miner, despite being the only thing i seem to find around here.%
i nearly fell into that blasted hole! what on earth are these devilish traps about?%
lets be careful when we move the caravan again, i dont want to lose my ox and cart down one of these death traps.%
dont stand still for too long, he'll get you for sure.%
aren't you a sight for sore eyes. i've been accosted by a nasty goblin sorcerer, flinging balls of fire down at me, the pest.%
i can hear him... the dirty ratbag, thinks he's better than us.%
he's cooped up that tower, and he isn't coming down without a fight. tihnk you could take care of him?%
glad that evil thing is finally gone, i couldn't be happier.%
i can finally get back to work, felling trees, killing green things, just what i love. Send workers if you like.%
a lumberdwarf asked me to rid his forest of a particular sorcerer.%
i killed the goblin sorcerer, and he was relieved to get back to work.%
no one knows where these pesky goblins even learn to use magic, they sure dont seem clever enough to figure it out on their own.%
im a lumberdwarf, but currently trying to keep my head for these cursed fireballs lately.%
the trees are strong here, you could harvest some good timber.%
the further north we go, the more dangerous it will get, be careful.%
ah yes, i tihnk i remember this place, there are some bustling dwarven markets nearby i gather.%
how are the markets, are they still here?%
what advice could i possibly give one like yourself.%
greetings hero! it is a great day indeed to finally come face to face with ye.%
how can i help, hero?%
speak to our leader, he will tell you.%
keep your head low, never underestimate the element of surprise.%
well met hero, we are eager to follow you, if you command.%
speak with our leader, he will tell you of our quest.%
i'm a thief, burglar, assassin, and master of stealthy arts.%
hail great hero! word of your deeds has spread far and wide, we could use your talents if you can spare us yer time.%
how goes your adventures great hero?%
a sickening druid has fortified himself in the ruins up ahead, he's ousted us again and again. but he'd be no trouble for you.%
we're forever in your debt. We will continue to spread word of your greatness.%
we ought to visit your settlement, kin, you are legend in these parts.%
a band of adventurers want my help to kill a druid.%
i killed the druid, and they rewarded me with gold and resources.%
we're adventurers, and we proudly support your cause, we even hoist your flag wherever we camp.%
what advice could i possibly give one like yourself.%
greetings hero! it is a great day indeed to finally come face to face with ye.%
how can i help, hero?%
speak to our leader, he will tell you.%
more ruins? interesting.%
what have you found here?%
this place has a foul stench, i dont like it.%
yikes! you scared me, i'm a bit on edge, some forest trolls came in and plundered our little town. I'm the last survivor.%
oh how i want revenege on those trolls, the foul beasts.%
i want vengeance, these trolls are the bane of my existence. if you kill them, i would be happy to join your settlement.%
i know i'm in capable hands, i'll come and join your settlement.%
hello traveller! it's nice to see you again.%
a lone survivor from a village wants me to kill the trolls that took over his town.%
i killed the trolls, and he's now joined my settlement.%
i'm a simple dwarf, and this was our humble village, now i have no where to go.%
this must be where that miner said his site was.%
didn't he say it was infested? with what i wonder.%
i heard dead-eyes the enslaver is running this fort, you'd better be carefully lad.%
ey! ma'friend told me ye needed some help. The wall is too strong, but I can dig out a tunnel if you'av the supplies.%
do you have 500 wood to spare?%
aye! for 500 timber, i can tunnel into the fort over there. do you have the supplies?%
aye! i have what i need, give me some time to get the tunnel built.%
i'll have the tunnel finished soon, come back later.%
a miner offered to tunnel into the orc stronghold for 500 timber.%
i gave him the timber, and he said it'd be ready soon.%
orcs are building strongholds all over the continent, they're trying to take over.%
i'm a miner! digging is what i'm good at.%
i heard about this stronghold, but no one dared siege it, the walls were too thick.%
i heard dead-eyes the enslaver is running this fort, you'd better be carefully lad.%
good to see ya again laddy! the tunnel is ready, it should take ye right into the belly of the beast.%
be careful, make sure you're ready to fight those monsters.%
aye, all is well, the tunnel is finished, go ahead.%
orcs are building strongholds all over the continent, they're trying to take over.%
i'm a miner! digging is what i'm good at.%
yikes, it's chilly in here, almost colder than it was outside! it doesn't seem natural to me.%
it's so icy in here.%
if ye can't handle the cold, best not be coming through these tunnels.%
greeting s'traveller, it's an unwelcoming place to be meeting kin.%
death'asnt got it's grip on us yet.%
i make do on me own, lad. %
if ye seek the famous weapon of ethin, yer off t'a'good start. tis said the secret to it's open'n is in a five rune sequence, hidden in this cave.%
i'm reclusive, ye kin. i do what i must.%
these caverns are fascinating.%
it'd be more interesting if it wasnt so cold.%
i should of brought an umbrella.%
i really dont enjoy the heat.%
leave me be, simple one.%
fool, you clearly do not understand what it is to be a hero. be gone!%
i do not wish to speak to fools, off with you!%
riddle%
you are not worthy, and have already failed my test.%
leave me be, simple one.%
leave me be, simple one.%
be thoughtful, a true hero knows the difference between glory and greed.%
ah, another traveller. You think you are worthy of my sacred artefact? then dare to solve my riddle.%
is my riddle too difficult for you?%
riddle%
here is my riddle. It is a glorious thing to conceal a treasure, but only a humble king can reveal it.%
you are wise young hero, you display the wisdom of a true dwarf lord.%
greetings again wise ruler, how may i help?%
a dwarf beduin gave me a riddle to solve.%
after discerning the answer to the riddle, he gave me an artefact.%
i am but a simple dwarf, i keep to my self.%
i am reclusive, and my matters are my own.%
seems quiet here, maybe there's nothing.%
anything interesting? it's very hot here.%
if ye have some armour that can help you resist the heat, i advise you to wear it.%
my luck indeed, you are legend hero, I would eagerly supply your settlement... er... but for a small problem.%
how are those fire weeds coming along? still pestering?%
fire weeds have sprouted through my site, nasty things. This cave is rich with raw bronze, there'd be plenty to go around if i can get it.%
you're a problem solver, that's for certain.%
greetings hero! how can i hep you?%
a miner needs me to clear his site of fire weeds.%
i cleared the fire weeds, we now have a good source of bronze.%
i heard the northern mountain range is home to some of the finest minerals.%
I'm a miner, and stumbling accross this cave was quite a find indeed, it has a rich source of bronze.%
it's hot in here, how odd.%
i dont believe i've ever ventured into a cave like this before.%
*hummmmmmmmm*%
a sentinel seems to want my help for something.%
the sentinel wanted me to activate the defense beacon.%
i wonder what this sentinel is all about.%
he seems friendly, i  wonder if he wants our help.%
greetings hero! you're presence is known in this continent.%
greetings hero! what can i do for you?%
i have no work for you, speak to oderin our leader.%
i'm trying to gather the remnants of this stronghold together, to reforge the once glorious hammerhand clan.%
hail kin! we are loyal to the clan of hammerhand, the mightiest hero of old. But this site has been defiled by vermin.%
aye, how can i help? have you gotten rid of that vermin kind?%
aye, a foul band of blue skins have taken residence here, they would overwhelm us, but with your help, perhaps we could clear them out.%
goblin filth, they are vermin, everywhere you look.%
greetings hero! a true pleasure to be in your presence.%
a hamerdwarf asked for my help to kill a band of blue skins.%
i killed the band of blue skins and was rewarded nicely.%
hammerhand was said to be the greatest battle strategist, his best strategy was bludgeoning foes until they stopped moving.%
a loyal follower of hammerhand's clan, though mostly myth and legend, we honour the heritage.%
speak with oderin, he will tell you of our troubles.%
a loyal follower of the hammerhand clan, we will restore order to this continent!%
this is quite a way from home.%
it's strangely quiet here.%
perhaps if you keep poking your nouse into things, you'll find something of value.%
what do you think you're doing! you can't be here! didnt you read the signs!? ... er, fine, i'm not fooling you it seems.%
what do you want? have you found... nevermind, i can't tell you. Come back when you've found it.%
i'm looking for something... it's very important, but i wont tell you what it is. Come back here if you find it.%
listen here lad, what i do is my own business, now leave me be!%
what trickery is this? these ruins look obscenely unstable!%
i sense an air of rune magic, there must be something about this place.%
welcome hero, to the receptacle of uderest the agile. but ye must learn the sacred phrase.%
have you found uderest's phrase? he was the most nimble dwarf to have lived.%
it is said the phrase was written on uderest's tower, located far to the north.%
the great and agile uderest is known for his great effort, to be the first dwarf to perform a full somersault.%
another fort? ruddy red skins, they're breedin' like rabbits.%
knock this fort down, and lets get on with it.%
yikes, another freezing cavern. I think i'll stay here.%
i know i go anywhere you go, but this really does suck.%
two beacons guard the runeforge of gesdun, one of fire, one of ice, i dare not go near them.%
come no further eager dwarf! what awaits you cannot be bested by blade. The mighty runeforge of gesdun is ahead, and remains guarded.%
only knowledge can best the foes ahead of you.%
if you wish to disable the guardians, you must find the sequence. i may know where the first part is hidden.%
i heard the first part of the sequence is hidden in the red sands, the second part remains a mystery to me.%
the acolyte guarding gesdun's runeforge said the red sands held the key.%
there are a lot of blue skins up this way, we ought to watch ourselves.%
i hate blue skins, they're nasty, tougher than their red skin counterpart.%
the wilds up here are unheard of i've never seen such a climate.%
worgs are terrifying, i'd happily never see one again.%
ice magic is deadly stuff, yer armour aint no good against it.%
aye, laddy! fancy seeing ya 'ere. This snowfield is blistering wid'ice. And a nasty shaman is festering.%
'ello again lad, have ye taken care of that shaman?%
aye, accross the ice field'ere, he's wielding a nasty kind of magic. I'd pay for his'ed.%
a mighty foe, had ever i seen one, but ye dealt wid'him like a true hero.%
greetings hero, how's yer travels coming along?%
i heard of a mighty weapon sealed away in the mountains, the ice cleaver, or sum'thin.%
i'm a trekker, scout, i keep eyes on the pines up'ere in the north.%
this cave was well concealed, we never would have found it without that beacon.%
there must be something amazing hidden here, i can't wait ot see what it might be.%
don't become an acolyte, i really regret being sent here, i'm going stir crazy.%
wow! how'd you get here? sorry, it's been so long since i've seen anyone. I was sent here to guard these ruins, but... i've been here awhile.%
i'm so lonely, i havent seen another dwarf in so long. You can stay awhile, i dont mind.%
this was the last resting place of Gesdun the renown runesmith. the last of his handy work lies here, yet to be imbued.%
Gesdun was said to be the greatest runesmith to ever live, he would spend months forging the strongest steel before imbueing it.%
wolves can't climb, by my beard i'd be snack meat plenty a time if they could.%
h-how you'd get here? it's not safe, there are wolves about. I wouldn't dare get down, for the life of me, i'm terrified.%
h-have the w-w-wolves gone yet?%
desert snappers, these pesky wolves, oh i hate them, they give me the willies. I'm too scared to get down if they're still around.%
thank goodness you got rid of them.%
oh i'm so glad to be free of those beasts, they really give me trouble.%
a scared miner wants me to kill some woves nearby.%
i killed th ewolves, and he rewarded me with some armour.%
i was looking  for a new place to start up mining, but when i saw those wolves, i leapt up here.%
did you hear that?... hmm, maybe it was nothing.%
i wonder what that strange dwarf is doing up there.%
i'm alright, thanks.%
i'm a simple dwarf, i just find work where i can, help out here and there.%
another township, what a pleasant surprise.%
greetin's lad, tis a hot day.%
how can i help ya?%
aye, i think i have a job for you. There's a nice bit of dirt just near here, if ye can kill off the ruddy goblins, i'll pay.%
you've done plenty already lad, i got noth'n for ya now.%
aye, you'be a fine hero lad, i give ya'dat.%
a local farmer asked me to clear out a nearby region so he could till there.%
i cleared the area of goblins, and he rewarded me well.%
i've been tilling fields me'whole life, all i know is hitting the earth and ripping it's good parts out.%
aye, i'm on guard.%
best you leave me alone.%
i'm busy, leave me be.%
i'm standing watch.%
aye, i'm on guard.%
best you leave me alone.%
i'm busy, leave me be.%
i'm standing watch.%
i'm alright, thanks.%
i'm a simple dwarf, i just find work where i can, help out here and there.%
greetings lad, fine day. You looking for some work? i might have something for you.%
how do you do?%
aye, there's a war chief in these parts, i think he's upset at me for accidentally chopping down his tent, think you could handle him for me?%
you've helped me already lad.%
greetings hero, glad to be seeing you.%
a lumberdwarf needs me to slay a war chief with a vendetta.%
i killed the orc war chief, and the lumberdwarf rewarded me.%
im a lumberdwarf, i collect wood for the township.%
this land would be good for tilling, but i bet it's swarmed with goblins.%
it's getting too hot, i want to leave.%
i wonder what this place is all about.%
seems peaceful enough here.%
hello kin, i'm a sculptor, i believe in the pureness of dwarven art, true art derived from stone. not like that pesky bapsy.%
er, bapsy makes me sick, he thinks he's so talented, his art is cheap and tacky.%
bapsy%
a conceptualist, goes by the pseudonym, bapsy. What i wouldn't give to see the smug look wiped off his face.%
ha! i'm glad you put him in his place, that cheap nonsense he calls art, bah!%
greetings friend! what can i do for you?%
a dwarf sculptor seems to have a grudge against another artist.%
i destroyed bapsy's artwork, and the sculptor was most pleased.%
i'm a sculptor, it's a solitary and noble profession, carried down through centuries of folk lore and heritage.%
this looks bizarre, i wonder what it's all about.%
why would anyone want to live out in this heat?%
i've had enough! leave me!%
how... how could you do such a thing... the horror, my life's work... ruined... be gone! you fascist!%
...oh how... how ever will i survive... such beauty... such loss....%
you know nothing of art! be gone foul beast!%
you evil creature! be gone, you have no respect for the arts!%
i'm ruined! because of you! ... ooooooh... woe, woe is me....%
please do not touch the artwork.%
behold! it is I, the great bapsy, the terrific artist. I have incredible artistic abilities.%
do not intefere with my art pieces, they are astounding beauty.%
yes, i am amazing am i not? i'm glad you think so. Please, observe my great masterpieces here, and see how they inspire you.%
i had to move to the desert, so that my artwork could be perfected in isolation.%
did you not hear me? i am he! the great bapsy! the greatest artist of all.%

welcome hero, to my taming grounds, i'm a beastmaster, and all creatures obey me.%
creatures respond to dominance, as do all living things.%
beastmaster%
aye, for coin, ye can hire my beasts, they are astoundingly fast.%
i saw some yeti's roaming about near here, be careful, they're curious and unpredictable.%
i'm a beastmaster, i bend the will of creatures to serve my own.%
it's getting cold up here.%
i sure could use a nice warm yurt right about now.%
*woof wooooof*%
*woof*%
*woof woof... woof*%
watchout for this troll, he seems a nastier than most.%
an adventurer, thank my ginger beard! a troll just came barging into my farm, i thought i was ruined.%
is that ruddy troll gone?%
yep, a big nasty forest troll, obviously hungry, he stomped into my farm and started gobbling everything up. I could use your help to get my farm back.%
i'm glad you took care of it, those trolls are such pests.%
i'm glad to see you hero! how can i help?%
a farmer got chased out of his farm by a troll.%
i killed the troll and the farmer was pleased to get his farm back.%
there are so many mysteries, i wish i knew more about this continent.%
i'm a farmer, i've been planting and plowing for decades.%
we're far into the desert now, it's blazing hot.%
this must be where the third beacon is located. It's awfully quiet.%
have you found the beacon yet?%
never give up, our ancestors made their secrets difficult to reveal, but not impossible, you must always seek an answer.%
welcome hero, you are quite the uderest to make your way here. I commend you. Now go forth, light the beacon.%
greetings hero, you will be legend at this pace.%
yes, i have guarded this beacon for quite some time, you are the first to make it this far.%
the fourth beacon is said to have been lost in the murky mires to the east, i warn, the creatures within are unholy.%
greeting's adventurer, are ye looking for work? i might have something for you.%
those darn fire slugs, such beasts! whatever hole they came crawling out of, i wish they'd stay there.%
aye, fire slugs, the nasty buggers. They've been coming from somewhere north of here, if you can kill the queen, it'd help me greatly.%
i havent got anymore work for you, sorry.%
greetings hero! fine day. care for some ale?%
a dwarf in the desert asked me to kill the fire slug queen.%
i killed the queen and was rewarded generously.%
the orcs apparently have several strongholds on this continent, but the largest i've seen is on the south eastern point.%
in my younger years i was a scout, an explorer. Now i enjoy the solitude of the desert.%
this land would be good for tilling, but who knows what might come for you in this desert.%
i get a bad feeling about this place.%
oh my luck! i thought i'd have to leave this fortune behind. I found a vein of adamantine! can you believe it?%
ah yes, with those ice slugs gone, we can mine out the adamantine. Remember to send workers to help!%
adamantine%
yes, i thought i'd have to leave it behind, because of the ice slugs, but now that you're here, that could change.%
i've been exploring these caverns for months, but this is truly the best find i've ever had.%
if you seek out snowbeards grave, perhaps you may find knowledge on how to open this receptacle.%
yes, i guard this receptacle, it is said that snowbeards last words sealed it along with his powerful artefact ring.%
looks like ruins up ahead, hopefully well preserved by the ice.%
ice is easier to travel over, but it make me feel uneasy.%
be quick on ye feet, if yer foe tries to fling things at ye, best you get in der'faces.%
welcome laddy, if yer lookin'fer adventure, i got somethin'for ye. the slug queens are notorious foes, think ye can handle em?%
have ye killed those slugs? or dont you have what it takes?%
slug queens%
aye, three, in the caverns south of here, if ye prove yerself, i'll give you my prized artefact. But i doubt ye could.%
aye,  you've proven to be a mighty hero kin, i wouldnt stand in yer way.%
hail! hero! fine day to be seeing the likes of you.%
a hermit in the north said he'll give me a powerful artefact if i kill the slug queens.%
i killed the queens and he rewarded me with a powerful artefact.%
i use to be an adventurer like you once, but then i took an arrow... and shot a troll with it, t'was me last adventure.%
hmm, more ruins, our ancestors must have covered this expanse more than we know.%
are these dwarf ruins? must be! nothing else could last so long.%
thank goodness you're here, we could really use your help. please defend us from these goblins.%
are they all dead? i'm terrified!%
we're looking for a place to settle down, but these goblins accosted us, please, help us! i dont think we can hold them off.%
they didn't stand a chance against your arm! mighty dwarf lord! we shall travel back with you, to join your settlement.%
what a relief, you've saved us. Thank you hero, I can't wait to see this settlement of yours.%
a group of settlers need my help defending them from a siege of goblins.%
i killed the goblins and the settlers want to join my settlement.%
this blasted heat, it's giving me blisters.%
ooh, i'm so scared, we've been on the run for months now!%
are you our saviour hero?%
please, just keep us safe, that's al i can ask.%
i'm ready for these blights! stay alert.%
good to have you here to help us, hero.%
all i can ask is that you keep us safe from these goblins.%
i was a hunter, but what more can i do but use my bow to protect my fellow kin.%
ah, more ruins, they seem quite large.%
seek out the wisdom of our ancestors, you will be strengthened by their knowledge.%
ah, another adventurer, greetings.%
only a true dwarf with the wisdom of our ancestors can open the mysteries they left behind.%
there are five beacons here, once lit, they should unlock the receptacle behind me. But none has figured out the sequence.%
the receptacle here is rumoured to hold a mighty artefact weapon, said to be wreathed in everlasting flames.%
these ruins stand out from quite a distance, look at the structure of these, it's incredible.%
anything interesting about these ruins?%
i dont like the look of this, there must be goblins about.%
stay safe kin, we can't afford to lose you to the horde.%
wow, these are the ruins that dwarf was talking about, there must be something interesting here.%
this is exciting, i love exploring new places.%
don't be hasty with a forge, take yer time and fashion fine armour, it'll save yer life.%
greetings lad, good to see more of my kind, still surviving. I just got chased out of my home, but i dont give up.%
i'll have a bustling cotton farm up here, you'll see, life wont stop me from monopolising.%
i've moved on, but i'd pay a pretty penny to see that ol'fire-bite put to rest. He might still be where he chased me off, near here.%
i'm good, thank you, you've done me enough already. Good lad.%
greetings again hero, have you gone to see those ruins?%
a dwarf was recently chased out of his home, and wants revenge on the orc who did it.%
i killed the orc fire-bite, and was told about some ruins nearby.%
i found some concealed ruins nearby, i bet they have something fancy hidden inside.%
urist of all trades, master of none, that's my motto, live with what you can, put your hand to it all.%
is that cotton? how odd...%
perhaps there is a cotton farm nearby.%
if you collect an entire volume, you can learn much from it's full meaning.%
ah, another adventurer, you can peruse, but do not touch the books. You are standing in the greatest library on the continent.%
i will not share my library with you unless you can prove yourself.%
i have been searching for the forthgrit city, and it's continental beacon. If you find it, i will share all of my library with you.%
i'm astounded that you found it, and after all these years, still standing. spectacular!%
it is good to see you again kin, please, help yourself to reading.%
a librarian in the south asked me to find the forthgrit beacon.%
i found the beacon and he has now shared his entire library with me.%
i heard the forthgrit beacon was somewhere in the north, to be seen from other islands.%
i have dedicated my life to the searching of literature and compiling of our history. Please, do not hinder that.%
it's quiet, and quite serene here.%
i wouldn't mind staying here for awhile. put your feet up.%
that tower there, i bet it's guarded by orcs, they seem to infest the desert.%
orcs ahead, i can smell them from a mile away. It seems to be true, the orcs are rebuiulding their strongholds.%
f the orcs take over the surface of this continent, we will have no where left to live.%
something seems off about this place, these totems dont seem to be made by goblins.%
i have an uneasy feeling about this place, something is wrong.%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
thank my beard, these savages have cracked, we owe you our lives.%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
thank my beard, these savages have cracked, we owe you our lives.%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%

we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
we are getting out of here, these lunatics were going to eat us!%
this mire stinks like nothing i've ever smelt. It's unnatural.%
lets get out of here, i feel uneasy about this place.%
i wouldn't go beyond this point, not unless ye wield'n some mighty power, the dead beyond here are unkind.%
well this is a pleasant surprise, nice to see the face of my own kin. How goes traveller?%
best you stay clear of this mire, the dead walk, and not any lesser dead, but a beastly kind.%
i've just finished building this wall, i've made it my duty to seal these nasty undead here, lest they wander about the continent.%
i heard the dead here are the last of what remains of the long forgotten species we called humans.%
i've been on my own for quite some time, but i suppose my occupation is mining. I'm good with a pick and hammer.%
this wretched mire is intolerable, we should leave.%
it feels unsafe here, something sinister is at work.%
ouch, i stepped on a sharp rock!%
i'm bored, let's go.%
this looks interesting, i wonder what is going on.%
looks like our kin are building something.%
sorry, can't chit chat, too much work to do.%
sorry, can't chit chat, too much work to do.%
i'm fairly busy, maybe speak to someone else.%
i'm a builder, helping to construct our new fort, Billis.%
sorry, can't chit chat, too much work to do.%
sorry, can't chit chat, too much work to do.%
i'm fairly busy, maybe speak to someone else.%
i'm a builder, helping to construct our new fort, Billis.%
greetings hero, i've heard about you, you're becoming well known in these lands. Think you could lend us some wood?%
do you have enough timber to spare?%
wood (1,000)%
yes, we could use some more timber to help finish our fort, we're a bit short. I have this fancy ring i found, for payment.%
thanks for your help, once we finish our fort, those goblins will have trouble bothering us again.%
greetings hero! how's that ring? is it helpful?%
a foreman asked me for some timber to help construct their fort.%
i gave them timber to help finish building, and i got a magic ring in return.%
i'm a foreman, i'm a master in my trade, i'm organising this site. We're building a fort to protect us from neighbouring goblins.%
more ruins... well at least i can find some shade.%
you want to go now? i was about to have a nap...%
sentinels are slow, but they are very powerful.%
an adventurer! perfect! i could really use your help. i was delegated to guard this scared site, but it's been overrun.%
that sorcerer... how did he do it. he has the sentinels defending him.%
a nasty sorcerer found out how to control the sentinels, and now he's claimed the ruins for himself. I dont stand a chance.%
many more mysteries lay buried, our past is concealed by shrouds of unknowing%
oh, greetings hero! it's good to see you again.%
a goblin sorcerer invaded some ruins, and somehow got the sentinels to help him.%
i got rid of the goblin sorcerer, and the sentinels helping him.%
sentinels were made to guard our cities, originally so more dwarves could do what they loved, drink and mine valuable ore.%
what does it look like? i'm not a coal miner if that's what you were wondering.%
run away! they're coming!%
run away! they're coming!%
run away! they're coming!%
run away! they're coming!%
run away! they're coming!%
run away! they're coming!%
yikes, watchout for those crawlers! they look all kinds of nasty.%
i'm quite comfortable up here, really.%
this place gives me a very uneasy feeling.%
this place gives me a very uneasy feeling.%
this must be where the fifth beacon is, it couldn't be any further south than this.%
have you found the fifth beacon?%
when all of the twelve beacons are lit, we shall finally know where the passageway is, and we must be ready for anything.%
ah, welcome adventurer, i see you are doing quite well on your quest to light the beacons.%
speak with me if you would like to know more of our history.%
yes, once all twelve beacons are lit, the passageway to our home cavern, the expanse we once occupied beneath the earth, shall be revealed.%
many great expanses lie beneath the earth, some are hidden and concealed, like the one of our great ancestors. hopefully the beacons will show us.%
I am a loyal acolyte, i guard this beacon, only one of a few from the twelve that we have discovered.%
i'm not bringing this wagon onto that ice over there, it's not safe.%
i heard of a trader who lost his entire caravan falling into an ice lake.%
what... happened here?%
this is odd, whatever reason could there be an empty fort like this for?%
if you're quick handed, it's a good idea to hit magic projectiles back at your enemy.%
well, if it isnt the famous dwarf hero, we've heard lots about you, perhaps you can live up to your reputation.%
havent killed him yet? well, perhaps you aren't all they say you are.%
reputation%
we cleared out this red skin fort not long ago, but a nasty sorcerer is cooped up over there, we can't get at him.%
you live up to your name hero, that's certain.%
well well, we meet again hero, we're humbled to be in your presence.%
a red goblin sorcerer is giving some adventurers some trouble.%
i killed the sorcerer and was rewarded generously.%
the desert is overrun by the filthy red skin blighters, but not for long, we'll take care of them.%
i'm an adventurer, i've spent many years travelling the continent.%
aye, lad, the red skins are fierce but no match for the likes of us.%
we never sleep, we never rest until they're all dead.%
aye, if speak to urist here, he'll tell you how you can help.%
we're adventurers. We've been seeking out the last of red skin kind, exterminating them like vermin they are.%
humans were said to be larger than orcs even, and they sure make for frightening undead. be careful.%
oh, thank goodness, hero we only hoped for your arrival. we're in a spot of trouble.%
the undead are so ghastly, i hear they have been wandering from the mire east of here.%
we've travelled for miles, and the well just up ahead is guarded by two beastly undead, we can't fight them.%
you have lived up to your reputation, hero. i'm glad to finally witness it myself.%
it's great to see you again hero, please stay awhile.%
some merchants can't get to a well because of some undead.%
i killed the undead and they are now able to use the well.%
the mire to the east is apparently the source of these wicked undead. The last resting place of the human kind.%
we're traders, we make our life on the road.%
oh look, more adventurers!%
it's always good to see more of our kin.%
oh yes, we coudl use some help, hero. Speak to fleg.%
we're traders, we've been on the road for a long time now, we could use a drink.%
this smells like trouble, i'll stay back here, out of harm's way.%
careful where you stick your neck, one of these days something'll chop it off.%
something is very off about this place, we're getting closer to the eastern mire, it's putrid i hear.%
can you smell that? as if the heat wasn't bad enough, now this smell.%
the wilds up here are unheard ofm i'v never seen such a climate.%
i've seen that fat beast a few times, and i tell you this, you can't do much but beat her senseless.%
an adventurer, perfect! just what i need, looking for some work?%
is she dead? heh, didn't think so, that burly ol'girl aint going down without a real fight. obviosuly you aren't dwarf enough.%
i'm a scholar, see, there are some runes nearby i'd like to decipher, but the ice crawler queen is sitting on them. Could'ya handle that?%
i'm going to go decipher those runes, it's been on my mind for quite some time.%
well, nice to be in your presence again hero, how do you fare?%
a scholar asked me to kill the ice crawler queen.%
i've killed the queen, and was rewarded with a magic ring.%
ever wonder where crawlers come from? well, go take a look, you'll find out pretty quick.%
well i dabble here and there, but my real love is in our history, I want to document all that i find, for the sake of our kin.%
this place is drab, lets move on.%
did you find anything? i'm bored.%
this must be where the seventh beacon is. This cave looks quite large, though.%
have you found it? it could be anywhere.%
this must be where the next beacon is. i wonder where it is.%
you have almost lit all of the beacons, however this one ought to take you some time to get to.%
well it looks like you just missed it. This tower ascends and descends every 12 years.%
i know of your mission hero, but your tardiness has made you miss this opportunity. Best of luck.%
if you manage to light four more, including this one, our homeward cavern shall be revealed.%
once the beacons are lit, I believe you will need an experienced scholar to decipher the last message.%
well, there it is, the ninth beacon, it doesn't look so hard to get... oh.%
how are you going to get up there?%
what a dank cave this is. It could take awhile to find the beacon here.%
unless you want to know how to swing your pick, i don't have any good advice for you, sorry.%
aye! lad, this cave has an abundant source of minerals. But i'm in a spot of trouble. I'll happily share if you can help.%
i never thought those critters could be so dangerous.%
i'd start mining, but there's an infestation of plump helmets down there, not the nice kind. Think you can help?%
you've already helped enough, time to get working.%
how goes lad? send some workers, we have plenty to mine.%
a miner wants to share a cave, if i can clear i out of plump helmets.%
i cleared it out, and we can begin mining out the ore.%
im a miner, the true occupation for a dwarf.%
wow, did you see that? the ruins are moving.%
dwarf runes are veyr powerful, even centuries later they dont fade.%
it's really not safe for me to move the wagon along the ice, let's leave as soon as possible.%
this ice is not safe, we should move on.%
if you aren't use to the cold, you'd better think twice before taking on  blue skin shamans.%
just what we need! hero, you're most welcome here. We could sure use your help.%
those shamans must not be allowed to gather their strength. The end of blue skins is due.%
there are four blue skin shamans that have emerged, and they must be stopped before they bring us strife, please.%
we are much safer thanks to you, hero. We shall have many years of victorious peace.%
you are most welcome here hero, we are honoured to have you in our presence.%
the leader of one of the northern towns asked me to slay four shamans.%
i slayed the shamans, and brought peace to the township.%
there are some fascinating ruins in the north up here, some locals know where to find them.%
i'm the leader here, i helped build this settlement from the ground up, we have a foothold in the north, and shall keep it.%
greetings traveller, i could really use some help. are you interested in some coin?%
those worgs are wicked creatures, they all ought to be hunted down.%
i recently had to hightail it, getting chased by black worgs. There's a pack nearby, and they're in the middle of my trade route.%
i'm glad you got rid of those worgs, i can finally get back on the road.%
greetings hero! how goes your travels?%
a merchant asked me to get rid of a pack of black worgs.%
i killed the worgs and was rewarded by the merchant.%
i'm a merchant, i have a regular route around these parts.%
speak with someone else, i'm not hiring.%
we are stronger in numbers, dwarves can work very well together.%
aye, warmth traveller, are ye looking for work?%
my home town was the palce to be, how i miss it.%
my home town isn't far from here, i was wondering if you could visit, and let me know how my family is doing.%
please ... leave me.%
... oh, hello again%
a dwarf asked me to check on his old township, not far from here.%
the town was devastated, and the dwarf was stricken with melancholy.%
i was raised by the cold, they say it's good for you, the cold breeds the toughest dwarves.%
i came from a little town nearby, but moved here, to help construct this settlement.%
it looks like a township up ahead, let's investigate.%
i need to pee.%
be careful, this territory is home to red goblin and orc.%
we're deep in the territory of our enemies.%
i dont like the look of this, i'm not getting any closer, this smells like goblins.%
we're very close to an orc camp, be careful.%
watch out, i think orcs have a taste for dwarf meat.%
i'm ready to high tail it out of here if need be.%
another orc camp, this must be their home territory.%
we're close to the eastern coastline, i can smell the salt air.%
greetings adventurer, i've been excavating these ruins, i found a nifty chest i'd be willing to help open, if you can supply me.%
that chest sure looks interesting, i bet it has some unspeakable magical item. You could find out, for a few mere bars of steel...%
steel (100)%
if you supply me with 100 steel, i'd be well equipped to open that rune chest for you. ye interested?%
very handy, thank you.%
good doing business with you. no take backs.%
a miner excavated a rune chest, and wants 100 steel for it.%
i gave him the 100 steel, and he opened the chest.%
there are plenty of ruins around, they make a good supply of stone.%
i'm an explorer, i enjoy excavating ruins and spelunking caverns.%
we've finally made it to the twelfth beacon, i never thought we'd make it this far.%
we're so close now, this is the last beacon.%
you are more agile if you unequip your weapon.%
greetings adventurer, it seems you've made it to the last beacon. what a mighty effort.%
i believe the last beacon is trickier to decipher from the rest, you will need to find an experienced acolyte.%
there is a reclusive hermit, he is expertly wise and proficient in deciphering runes, you should seek him out if you need help deciphering.%
i have no quests for you adventurer, but i encourage you to continue your quest.%
An acolyte told me of an old hermit who is proficient in deciphering runes.%
i found the hermit, he has some bizarre ways of life.%
it takes many years and great wisdom to understand our ancient runes.%
i'm a loyal follower to our tradition and ancestry. I guard the last of the twelve beacons.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're not worth my time.%
oi! get out of here, what're ye doin'ya bubblin fool. Shoo, this is private property.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're not worth my time.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're not worth my time.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're not worth my time.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're not worth my time.%
I wouldn't be heading into that hell hole of rothgar anytime soon, best you get some dumb dwarves to help you instead.%
ah, so you're the one who lit the beacons. No doubt you need my help to decipher them. typical.%
why are you still here?! shoo, get lost, you're nto worth my time.%
hmm, well if what you say is true, then it sounds like the beacons mean to direct you into the heart of rothgar.%
oh? dont you know? Rothgar is where the goblin king resides. His throne room is at the very center. %
the dwarf hermit deciphered the beacon runes, and said it pointed to the heart of rothgar.%
he seemed to find it funny, in an unsympathetic manner.%
rothgar is the mountain north west of here, the largest of the mountains on the continent.%
rothgar is northwest of the hermit's cottage. Apparently the largest mountain in the region.%
what i do is my own business, i'll help you decipher those runes, but that's it, leave me to my books.%
goodness, would you look at that... dwarven engineering no doubt.%
only dwarves can build such law defying geometry.%
something's fishy about these ruins.%
i wonder what you'll find around here.%
it's extra pungent here, it's unbearable.%
i feel sick, i want to go.%
those undead pack a punch, too bad they burn like kindling.%
oi! you here to take ma'land? think again buster! this is my land, rack off!%
you think i'm scared of you? bah! i've held off swathes of goblins and orcs, they make good fertilizer.%
I trapped a skeleton in my shed, interrogate him, see if he'll squawk, I want to kill the source of whatever creates those things.%
i'm all out of jobs, but i know a few good drinking games.%
aye, good to see ya again, fancy a drink? homebrew!%
a tough local farmer wants me to find the source of the undead rising.%
i found the source and cut it off, i was rewarded with a fancy artefact.%
something is festering in the swamps east of here, i can't stand the smell of it. It's raising the dead.%
i'm a farmer, ain't nothing getting me off my land, not even the goblin king! he wouldn't dare set foot here.%
if you want to investigate the swamps, i wont stop you. it makes me nauseous, although, you're welcome to go there.%
please! no! please! dont hurt me, i beg of you!%
i-i-i really dont want any trouble, please let me go kind sir, it's been an awful day for me.%
interrogate%
h-honestly, i haven't the foggiest idea of what you want from me, sir. This ghastly beast locked me into his shed, with no provocation.%
thank you kindly, dear sir, for your attentiveness, but i'm afraid that's all i know.%
you seem nice enough. The moment he's not looking, i'll make a run for it, and hopefully see you again some day.%
the undead in the farmer's shed... is... rather polite.%
it seems this skeleton isn't aware that he's been reanimated... or dead...%
you really ought to stay away from that farmer, he's stark mad, he might lock you up as well!%
i use to be a butler, i'm quite good at it. But i... i'm very lost, to be honest, i have no clue where i am.%
this is an odd place to work a farm, it can't be very safe.%
whoever lives here is either dead already or very good at taking care of themselves.%
those worgs are fast, but if you hit them in the back, they'll know it.%
aye! bless yer beard lad, this is a great day indeed. I'm in need of a hero like you.%
those rascals, i've been tracking them for weeks.%
aye, i've tracked some goblin worg riders down here. They're bound to cause trouble, i could use yer help.%
hail hero! you're mighty indeed!%
hail hero! to be in yer presence is a true gift.%
a tracker wants my help killing some worg riders.%
we killed the worg riders, and parted ways.%
no one knows how goblins trained worgs, considering how stupid they are.%
i was a scout, but now i've taken on a life of adventure.%
look! another adventurer!%
i have a terrible feeling about this place, i hate travelling on ice.%
there aren't any of our kin in this wasteland, it's controlled entirely by orcs.%
i hate orcs, they're a true plague to our kin.%
it looks like an old town use to be here, no doubt the orcs have ravaged it.%
orcs are savage, with no respect for logic and reason.%
i can patch you up if you need, for coin of course.%
well well, another adventurer, what a pleasant surprise. Call me venom, i'm an explorer as well.%
i use to have quite the alchemy setup. i'm still quite handy if you need a patchup.%
there's an old town south east of here, i was run out many years ago, but if you can clear out any orcs, i'll pay for your service.%
i can't wait to rummage through my old alchemy lab, i had a lot of useful bits and pieces.%
greetings kin, how goes your travels?%
venom, an explroer asked me to clear his old town of orcs.%
i cleared the town, and was rewarded with one of his favored weapons.%
orcs will roam about their territory, they dont leave anything unguarded.%
i'm an explorer, but i dabble in many arts, particularly alchemy and chemistry.%
i can't go any further, the wagon will get stuck.%
this place is thick with subterranean flora.%
it smells like goblin to me, watch out.%
find any goblins? nasty vermin.%
well, i never would have thought there'd be ruins here, the ice must have covered most of it up.%
this area was hard to find, i'm not entirely sure how we got here.%
this icefield is thick, i think it continues east.%
this must be a part of the large north eastern icefield.%
open dis cage, i kill you!%
i nots talk to dwoff scummzz!!%
*growls* kill me, or shuts up, filthy dwoff.%
*growls* you weak, I tuff, i not break!%
not speakn to stoopid dof.%
i'm killer, i kills dwoffs, i like kill'n.%
your shield is your greatest ally, kin.%
hail hero! we're heard of your great deeds and decided to help the good cause!%
hail hero! how may we be of service?%
indeed hero! our efforts have irritated the orcs, but if you could clear the lands near here, we would have a better vantage point.%
you have advanced the fight against the orcs more than any dwarf, hail hero!%
hail hero! it is great to see you again!%
i've been asked to clear the surrounding area of orcs.%
i cleared the areas and helped the fight against the orcs.%
the orcs have been training beserkers, fast and ruthless foes. Be careful.%
i lead these dwarves, we're making a stand against the orcs here. We are fighting back!%
speak to our leader, he will tell you of our goals.%
we're bringing the fight to the orcs! no more sitting around waiting to die, it's time they felt our strength!%
crossbow bolts are great for piercing orc armour.%
speak to our leader, he will tell you of our goals.%
i'm on guard, need to keep an eye out for more orc vermin.%
speak to our leader, he will tell you of our goals.%
i'm on guard, watching for more orcs. scum!%
it's quiet, i wonder where the orcs are.%
we could use more allies in our travels.%
we're in orc territory, be careful.%
there are orcs everywhere here, it's not safe.%
we really ought to move on from here.%
oh! hey! you, i could use your help. My buddy went spelunkin' down these tunnels, but he hasn't come back.%
have you found urist? he's quite a sneaky little fellow.%
if you can find my brother, i'd be most grateful, he's been gone awhile. I hope nothing gobbled him up.%
you've been a great help, hero. Thanks, once again.%
greetings hero! good to see you again.%
me and my brother urist have been looking for an adamantine mine, we were told there was one around here.%
did you see that hole? i almost fell right in!%
gotta be careful, this poor beast of burden has travelled further than any other.%
oh, hello again! i'm glad you were here to help me.%
you've already helped me a great deal. Saved my life even!%
we're miners, it's been tough, but we'll get a lucky break sooner or later.%
best you bring a friend when spelunking.%
oh, thank goodness! what trouble i got myself into. If you didn't come by, i'd be a goner.%
I dont think i could have stayed hidden much longer, those nasty creatures would have gotten me.%
by my beard! you've saved me, hero! i can't thank you enough. Tell my brother i'll make my way up.%
well i heard there were some adamantine mines up north, but we haven't found any yet.%
my brother and I are miners, it's been tough, but we'll get a lucky break sooner or later.%
be on your toes, don't let worgs dance around you.%
greetings kin, be careful, these pines are filled with worgs. Goblins come here to catch and tame them.%
stay alert! there be worg scouts around. keep a sharp eye out.%
i ain't got work for you. But if it's safe, send some hunters, there's plenty of game to around.%
this place is perfect for hunting, but for the goblin worg riders. They're roamin' these woods.%
hear that? wolves... lots of them...%
i'll stay here, and make myself ready for a quick escape.%
we're now in the rothgar range, there are unspeakable things here, be careful.%
watch yourself, the rothgar goblins are said to be the most dangerous.%
rothgar is not safe, the goblins here are tough, iron clad and stark mad.%
aye, greetings lad, these woods are full of worgs, good for skins.%
i'm just trying to cut down all these disgusting trees, but don't mind me.%
aye, there's an ice druid who's on a vendetta to kill me, doesn't like my occupation. Get him off my back would ya?%
good riddens, that ice druid was raving mad. nothing natural about dwarves and green things.%
greetings kin, nice seeing you again.%
a lumberdwarf asked me to kill some ice druid.%
i killed the druid and he rewarded me with a powerful halberd.%
i heard the ice druid was north somewhere. sick in the head that dwarf.%
im a lumberdwarf, i cut down filthy trees.%
careful, this mountain is full of goblins, no doubt you'll find them here.%
i'm ready to leave when you are.%
oh look at this, lots of fresh mushrooms, a good place to harvest food.%
we ought to send workers here, it's packed full of mushrooms.%
i can hear goblin's from here. their screeching is chilling.%
goblin vermin, cannonfodder, every last one of them.%
it looks like we're here, the great treasure hall. I wonder what is buried here.%
it's amazing to think all these things have lasted so long.%
we're finally here, it could get ugly. I brought your storage chest, just in case you forgot to bring something.%
the throne room must be close, when you see the goblin king, do me a favor, and kill him.%
the goblin king is fat and slow, but he can hit hard. be careful.%
greetings hero, I heard the news and decided to come and cheer you on.%
the goblin king's throne room is very near to us, you may be able to take him by surprise.%
hero, i have no work for you but the task ahead.%
the goblin king is a bulbous monstrosity. i hear nothing but iron can damage his stature.%
i'm a loyal follower to our tradition. I hope the answers to our ancestry will be found here.%
Greetings traveller, how are your adventures going?%
it's a fine day, what would you like to talk about?%
hail kin! it's always good to see more of our kind%
hello again, how can i help?%
hail kin, fine day%
greetings traveller, how goes?%
good to see you kin!%
never trim your beard, the worth of a dwarf is measured by the length of his beard and the girth of his... belt%
most dwarfs believe that our ancient ruins still hold many magical artifacts, yet to be excavated%
it's always good to keep your armour in good condition, it wont do you much good if it's all battered up%
have you seen a physician lately? it's always good to keep yourself in shape%
if you have room in your caravan, it's always good to bring someone with you, we get our strength in numbers%
never underestimate your foe, let down your guard for just a second and you can lose an eye!%
dont be too hasty when adventuring the depths, you can miss a lot of valuable things in the low light%
i like to use swords, they're much better at getting fatal blows on your enemy%
warhammers are great for bludgeoning foes with armour, they can't do much against a mallet!%
shielding foes dont turn as quick, they wont be able to block you from behind%
you should try beginning a powerful attack in anticipation for your enemies moves%
you can attack whilst jumping or falling. it's a great way to come down on several foes at once%
a well timed dash can avoid anything! timing is key%
pay close attention to runes, especially if they're still lit, it means they still serve a purpose.%
our ancestors used runes for all sorts of purposes, dont underestimate them.%
some armour is so tough it can completely block a troll's bludgeoning.%
you seem to know more than me, i dont know what i could offer.%
i'm too fat to hide behind trees, i dont bother trying.%
If you have a strong swing, and well timed, you can whack fireballs back toward your enemy.%
there is talk about cave trolls returning to the depths of the land, apparently they werent all killed off%
i once heard that goblins have a terrible habit for attacking before they think%
if you ever find the grave of axebeard the great, be sure to have a good look around%
there is word of a goblin king, massing an army beneath one of the great mountains, i do hope it isnt true%
i havent heard much recently, sorry%
once i saw a vein of adamantine, but i couldnt stop for it, i was on the run for my life%
i heard the orcs are returning, to ensure our fate is sealed%
apparently the trolls are returning, the depths of the land are becoming less safe%
you'll think i'm crazy, but i heard the trolls have begun building a city beneath the earth, whatever for i wonder%
there use to be a great dwarven wizard who lived in the northern most parts of the continent, no one knows what happened to him or where he went%
the hordes are erratic and unpredictable, nothing is ever as you think it should be.%
watchout for the blue skins, i hear they've been lingering outside of their usual northen territories.%
red goblins prefer the desert climate, but they've taken to tunnelling of late.%
i hate poison, nothing worse than feeling sluggish and useless, many creatures in the depths use toxins to seal your fate.%
dont underestimate fire, if your beard catches aflame, you'll burn to a crisp in no time.%
i hear the south has more active ruins.%
orcs are apparently smarter than goblins, but they're all thick skulled in my opinion%
i heard some dwarves in the southern region have become fanciful with green things, what nonsense!%
there is a vicious sect of orcs called the black bloods, they are fierce and frightening.%
i heard something interesting the other day... nevermind, i've forgotten it.%
my friend urist said he found a pure vein of adamantine, what nonsense.%
apparently orcs have learned how to train worgs, it's a scary thought.%
once I saw a dwarf thwop a fireball right back in a shaman's face.%
well done! here's your reward for the bounty.%
alright, i'll wait here%
lead on, i'm right behind  you!%
